I oughterve been up an hour ago I know what twas made me so precious sleepy I went to the Old Bowery last night and didnt turn in till past twelve You went to the Old Bowery? Whered you get your money? asked the man who was a porter in the employ of a firm doing business on Spruce Street Made it by shines in course My guardian dont allow me no money for theatres so I have to earn it Some boys get it easier than that said the porter significantly You dont catch me stealin if thats what you mean said Dick Dont you ever steal then? No and I wouldnt Lots of boys does it but I wouldnt Well Im glad to hear you say that I believe theres some good in you Dick after all Oh Im a rough customer! said Dick But I wouldnt steal Its mean Im glad you think so Dick and the rough voice sounded gentler than at first Have you got any money to buy your breakfast? No but Ill soon get some While this conversation had been going on Dick had got up His bedchamber had been a wooden box half full of straw on which the young boot-black had reposed his weary limbs and slept as soundly as if it had been a bed of down He dumped down into the straw without taking the trouble of undressing Getting up too was an equally short process He jumped out of the box shook himself picked out one or two straws that had found their way into rents in his clothes and drawing a well-worn cap over his uncombed locks he was all ready for the business of the day Dicks appearance as he stood beside the box was rather peculiar His pants were torn in several places and had apparently belonged in the first instance to a boy two sizes larger than himself He wore a vest all the buttons of which were gone except two out of which peeped a shirt which looked as if it had been worn a month To complete his costume he wore a coat too long for him dating back if one might judge from its general appearance to a remote antiquity Washing the face and hands is usually considered proper in commencing the day but Dick was above such refinement He had no particular dislike to dirt and did not think it necessary to remove several dark streaks on his face and hands But in spite of his dirt and rags there was something about Dick that was attractive It was easy to see that if he had been clean and well dressed he would have been decidedly good-looking Some of his companions were sly and their faces inspired distrust; but Dick had a frank straight-forward manner that made him a favorite Dicks business hours had commenced He had no office to open His little blacking-box was ready for use and he looked sharply in the faces of all who passed addressing each with Shine yer boots sir? How much? asked a gentleman on his way to his office Ten cents said Dick dropping his box and sinking upon his knees on the sidewalk flourishing his brush with the air of one skilled in his profession Ten cents! Isnt that a little steep? Well you know taint all clear profit said Dick who had already set to work Theres the _blacking_ costs something and I have to get a new brush pretty often And you have a large rent too said the gentleman quizzically with a glance at a large hole in Dicks coat Yes sir said Dick always ready to joke; I have to pay such a big rent for my manshun up on Fifth Avenoo that I cant afford to take less than ten cents a shine Ill give you a bully shine sir Be quick about it for I am in a hurry So your house is on Fifth Avenue is it? It isnt anywhere else said Dick and Dick spoke the truth there What tailor do you patronize? asked the gentleman surveying Dicks attire Would you like to go to the same one? asked Dick shrewdly Well no; it strikes me that he didnt give you a very good fit This coat once belonged to General Washington said Dick comically He wore it all through the Revolution and it got torn some cause he fit so hard When he died he told his widder to give it to some smart young feller that hadnt got none of his own; so she gave it to me But if youd like it sir to remember General Washington by Ill let you have it reasonable Thank you but I wouldnt want to deprive you of it And did your pants come from General Washington too? No they was a gift from Lewis Napoleon Lewis had outgrown em and sent em to me hes bigger than me and thats why they dont fit It seems you have distinguished friends Now my lad I suppose you would like your money I shouldnt have any objection said Dick I believe said the gentleman examining his pocket-book I havent got anything short of twenty-five cents Have you got any change? Not a cent said Dick All my moneys invested in the Erie Railroad Thats unfortunate Shall I get the money changed sir? I cant wait; Ive got to meet an appointment immediately Ill hand you twenty-five cents and you can leave the change at my office any time during the day All right sir Where is it? No 125 Fulton Street Shall you remember? Yes sir What name? Greyson office on second floor All right sir; Ill bring it I wonder whether the little scamp will prove honest said Mr Greyson to himself as he walked away If he does Ill give him my custom regularly If he dont as is most likely I shant mind the loss of fifteen cents Mr Greyson didnt understand Dick Our ragged hero wasnt a model boy in all respects I am afraid he swore sometimes and now and then he played tricks upon unsophisticated boys from the country or gave a wrong direction to honest old gentlemen unused to the city A clergyman in search of the Cooper Institute he once directed to the Tombs Prison and following him unobserved was highly delighted when the unsuspicious stranger walked up the front steps of the great stone building on Centre Street and tried to obtain admission I guess he wouldnt want to stay long if he did get in thought Ragged Dick hitching up his pants Leastways I shouldnt Theyre so precious glad to see you that they wont let you go but board you gratooitous and never send in no bills Another of Dicks faults was his extravagance Being always wide-awake and ready for business he earned enough to have supported him comfortably and respectably There were not a few young clerks who employed Dick from time to time in his professional capacity who scarcely earned as much as he greatly as their style and dress exceeded his But Dick was careless of his earnings Where they went he could hardly have told himself However much he managed to earn during the day all was generally spent before morning He was fond of going to the Old Bowery Theatre and to Tony Pastors and if he had any money left afterwards he would invite some of his friends in somewhere to have an oyster-stew; so it seldom happened that he commenced the day with a penny Then I am sorry to add that Dick had formed the habit of smoking This cost him considerable for Dick was rather fastidious about his cigars and wouldnt smoke the cheapest Besides having a liberal nature he was generally ready to treat his companions But of course the expense was the smallest objection No boy of fourteen can smoke without being affected injuriously Men are frequently injured by smoking and boys always But large numbers of the newsboys and boot-blacks form the habit Exposed to the cold and wet they find that it warms them up and the self-indulgence grows upon them It is not uncommon to see a little boy too young to be out of his mothers sight smoking with all the apparent satisfaction of a veteran smoker There was another way in which Dick sometimes lost money There was a noted gambling-house on Baxter Street which in the evening was sometimes crowded with these juvenile gamesters who staked their hard earnings generally losing of course and refreshing themselves from time to time with a vile mixture of liquor at two cents a glass Sometimes Dick strayed in here and played with the rest I have mentioned Dicks faults and defects because I want it understood to begin with that I dont consider him a model boy But there were some good points about him nevertheless He was above doing anything mean or dishonorable He would not steal or cheat or impose upon younger boys but was frank and straight-forward manly and self-reliant His nature was a noble one and had saved him from all mean faults I hope my young readers will like him as I do without being blind to his faults Perhaps although he was only a boot-black they may find something in him to imitate And now having fairly introduced Ragged Dick to my young readers I must refer them to the next chapter for his further adventures CHAPTER II JOHNNY NOLAN After Dick had finished polishing Mr Greysons boots he was fortunate enough to secure three other customers two of them reporters in the Tribune establishment which occupies the corner of Spruce Street and Printing House Square When Dick had got through with his last customer the City Hall clock indicated eight oclock He had been up an hour and hard at work and naturally began to think of breakfast He went up to the head of Spruce Street and turned into Nassau Two blocks further and he reached Ann Street On this street was a small cheap restaurant where for five cents Dick could get a cup of coffee and for ten cents more a plate of beefsteak with a plate of bread thrown in These Dick ordered and sat down at a table It was a small apartment with a few plain tables unprovided with cloths for the class of customers who patronized it were not very particular Our heros breakfast was soon before him Neither the coffee nor the steak were as good as can be bought at Delmonicos; but then it is very doubtful whether in the present state of his wardrobe Dick would have been received at that aristocratic restaurant even if his means had admitted of paying the high prices there charged Dick had scarcely been served when he espied a boy about his own size standing at the door looking wistfully into the restaurant This was Johnny Nolan a boy of fourteen who was engaged in the same profession as Ragged Dick His wardrobe was in very much the same condition as Dicks Had your breakfast Johnny? inquired Dick cutting off a piece of steak No Come in then Heres room for you I aint got no money said Johnny looking a little enviously at his more fortunate friend Havent you had any shines? Yes I had one but I shant get any pay till to-morrow Are you hungry? Try me and see Come in Ill stand treat this morning Johnny Nolan was nowise slow to accept this invitation and was soon seated beside Dick Whatll you have Johnny? Same as you Cup o coffee and beefsteak ordered Dick These were promptly brought and Johnny attacked them vigorously Now in the boot-blacking business as well as in higher avocations the same rule prevails that energy and industry are rewarded and indolence suffers Dick was energetic and on the alert for business but Johnny the reverse The consequence was that Dick earned probably three times as much as the other How do you like it? asked Dick surveying Johnnys attacks upon the steak with evident complacency Its hunky I dont believe hunky is to be found in either Websters or Worcesters big dictionary; but boys will readily understand what it means Do you come here often? asked Johnny Most every day Youd better come too I cant afford it Well youd ought to then said Dick What do you do Id like to know? I dont get near as much as you Dick Well you might if you tried I keep my eyes open thats the way I get jobs Youre lazy thats whats the matter Johnny did not see fit to reply to this charge Probably he felt the justice of it and preferred to proceed with the breakfast which he enjoyed the more as it cost him nothing Breakfast over Dick walked up to the desk and settled the bill Then followed by Johnny he went out into the street Where are you going Johnny? Up to Mr Taylors on Spruce Street to see if he dont want a shine Do you work for him reglar? Yes Him and his partner wants a shine most every day Where are you goin? Down front of the Astor House I guess Ill find some customers there At this moment Johnny started and dodging into an entry way hid behind the door considerably to Dicks surprise Whats the matter now? asked our hero Has he gone? asked Johnny his voice betraying anxiety Who gone Id like to know? That man in the brown coat What of him You aint scared of him are you? Yes he got me a place once Where? Ever so far off What if he did? I ran away Didnt you like it? No I had to get up too early It was on a farm and I had to get up at five to take care of the cows I like New York best Didnt they give you enough to eat? Oh yes plenty And you had a good bed? Yes Then youd better have stayed You dont get either of them here Whered you sleep last night? Up an alley in an old wagon You had a better bed than that in the country didnt you? Yes it was as soft as as cotton Johnny had once slept on a bale of cotton the recollection supplying him with a comparison Why didnt you stay? I felt lonely said Johnny Johnny could not exactly explain his feelings but it is often the case that the young vagabond of the streets though his food is uncertain and his bed may be any old wagon or barrel that he is lucky enough to find unoccupied when night sets in gets so attached to his precarious but independent mode of life that he feels discontented in any other He is accustomed to the noise and bustle and ever-varied life of the streets and in the quiet scenes of the country misses the excitement in the midst of which he has always dwelt Johnny had but one tie to bind him to the city He had a father living but he might as well have been without one Mr Nolan was a confirmed drunkard and spent the greater part of his wages for liquor His potations made him ugly and inflamed a temper never very sweet working him up sometimes to such a pitch of rage that Johnnys life was in danger Some months before he had thrown a flat-iron at his sons head with such terrific force that unless Johnny had dodged he would not have lived long enough to obtain a place in our story He fled the house and from that time had not dared to re-enter it Somebody had given him a brush and box of blacking and he had set up in business on his own account But he had not energy enough to succeed as has already been stated and I am afraid the poor boy had met with many hardships and suffered more than once from cold and hunger Dick had befriended him more than once and often given him a breakfast or dinner as the case might be Howd you get away? asked Dick with some curiosity Did you walk? No I rode on the cars Whered you get your money? I hope you didnt steal it I didnt have none What did you do then? I got up about three oclock and walked to Albany Wheres that? asked Dick whose ideas on the subject of geography were rather vague Up the river How far? About a thousand miles said Johnny whose conceptions of distance were equally vague Go ahead What did you do then? I hid on top of a freight car and came all the way without their seeing me* That man in the brown coat was the man that got me the place and Im afraid hed want to send me back * A fact Well said Dick reflectively I dunno as Id like to live in the country I couldnt go to Tony Pastors or the Old Bowery There wouldnt be no place to spend my evenings But I say its tough in winter Johnny specially when your overcoats at the tailors an likely to stay there Thats so Dick But I must be goin or Mr Taylorll get somebody else to shine his boots Johnny walked back to Nassau Street while Dick kept on his way to Broadway That boy soliloquized Dick as Johnny took his departure aint got no ambition Ill bet he wont get five shines to-day Im glad I aint like him I couldnt go to the theatre nor buy no cigars nor get half as much as I wanted to eat Shine yer boots sir? Dick always had an eye to business and this remark was addressed to a young man dressed in a stylish manner who was swinging a jaunty cane Ive had my boots blacked once already this morning but this confounded mud has spoiled the shine Ill make em all right sir in a minute Go ahead then The boots were soon polished in Dicks best style which proved very satisfactory our hero being a proficient in the art I havent got any change said the young man fumbling in his pocket but heres a bill you may run somewhere and get changed Ill pay you five cents extra for your trouble He handed Dick a two-dollar bill which our hero took into a store close by Will you please change that sir? said Dick walking up to the counter The salesman to whom he proffered it took the bill and slightly glancing at it exclaimed angrily Be off you young vagabond or Ill have you arrested Whats the row? Youve offered me a counterfeit bill I didnt know it said Dick Dont tell me Be off or Ill have you arrested CHAPTER III DICK MAKES A PROPOSITION Though Dick was somewhat startled at discovering that the bill he had offered was counterfeit he stood his ground bravely Clear out of this shop you young vagabond repeated the clerk Then give me back my bill That you may pass it again? No sir I shall do no such thing It doesnt belong to me said Dick A gentleman that owes me for a shine gave it to me to change A likely story said the clerk; but he seemed a little uneasy Ill go and call him said Dick He went out and found his late customer standing on the Astor House steps Well youngster have you brought back my change? You were a precious long time about it I began to think you had cleared out with the money That aint my style said Dick proudly Then wheres the change? I havent got it Wheres the bill then? I havent got that either You young rascal! Hold on a minute mister said Dick and Ill tell you all about it The man what took the bill said it wasnt good and kept it The bill was perfectly good So he kept it did he? Ill go with you to the store and see whether he wont give it back to me Dick led the way and the gentleman followed him into the store At the reappearance of Dick in such company the clerk flushed a little and looked nervous He fancied that he could browbeat a ragged boot-black but with a gentleman he saw that it would be a different matter He did not seem to notice the newcomers but began to replace some goods on the shelves Now said the young man point out the clerk that has my money Thats him said Dick pointing out the clerk The gentleman walked up to the counter I will trouble you he said a little haughtily for a bill which that boy offered you and which you still hold in your possession It was a bad bill said the clerk his cheek flushing and his manner nervous It was no such thing I require you to produce it and let the matter be decided The clerk fumbled in his vest-pocket and drew out a bad-looking bill This is a bad bill but it is not the one I gave the boy It is the one he gave me The young man looked doubtful Boy he said to Dick is this the bill you gave to be changed? No it isnt You lie you young rascal! exclaimed the clerk who began to find himself in a tight place and could not see the way out This scene naturally attracted the attention of all in the store and the proprietor walked up from the lower end where he had been busy Whats all this Mr Hatch? he demanded That boy said the clerk came in and asked change for a bad bill I kept the bill and told him to clear out Now he wants it again to pass on somebody else Show the bill The merchant looked at it Yes thats a bad bill he said There is no doubt about that But it is not the one the boy offered said Dicks patron It is one of the same denomination but on a different bank Do you remember what bank it was on? It was on the Merchants Bank of Boston Are you sure of it? I am Perhaps the boy kept it and offered the other You may search me if you want to said Dick indignantly He doesnt look as if he was likely to have any extra bills I suspect that your clerk pocketed the good bill and has substituted the counterfeit note It is a nice little scheme of his for making money I havent seen any bill on the Merchants Bank said the clerk doggedly You had better feel in your pockets This matter must be investigated said the merchant firmly If you have the bill produce it I havent got it said the clerk; but he looked guilty notwithstanding I demand that he be searched said Dicks patron I tell you I havent got it Shall I send for a police officer Mr Hatch or will you allow yourself to be searched quietly? said the merchant Alarmed at the threat implied in these words the clerk put his hand into his vest-pocket and drew out a two-dollar bill on the Merchants Bank Is this your note? asked the shopkeeper showing it to the young man It is I must have made a mistake faltered the clerk I shall not give you a chance to make such another mistake in my employ said the merchant sternly You may go up to the desk and ask for what wages are due you I shall have no further occasion for your services Now youngster said Dicks patron as they went out of the store after he had finally got the bill changed I must pay you something extra for your trouble Heres fifty cents Thank you sir said Dick Youre very kind Dont you want some more bills changed? Not to-day said he with a smile Its too expensive Im in luck thought our hero complacently I guess Ill go to Barnums to-night and see the bearded lady the eight-foot giant the two-foot dwarf and the other curiosities too numerous to mention Dick shouldered his box and walked up as far as the Astor House He took his station on the sidewalk and began to look about him Just behind him were two persons one a gentleman of fifty; the other a boy of thirteen or fourteen They were speaking together and Dick had no difficulty in hearing what was said I am sorry Frank that I cant go about and show you some of the sights of New York but I shall be full of business to-day It is your first visit to the city too Yes sir Theres a good deal worth seeing here But Im afraid youll have to wait to next time You can go out and walk by yourself but dont venture too far or you will get lost Frank looked disappointed I wish Tom Miles knew I was here he said He would go around with me Where does he live? Somewhere up town I believe Then unfortunately he is not available If you would rather go with me than stay here you can but as I shall be most of the time in merchants-counting-rooms I am afraid it would not be very interesting I think said Frank after a little hesitation that I will go off by myself I wont go very far and if I lose my way I will inquire for the Astor House Yes anybody will direct you here Very well Frank I am sorry I cant do better for you Oh never mind uncle I shall be amused in walking around and looking at the shop-windows There will be a great deal to see Now Dick had listened to all this conversation Being an enterprising young man he thought he saw a chance for a speculation and determined to avail himself of it Accordingly he stepped up to the two just as Franks uncle was about leaving and said I know all about the city sir; Ill show him around if you want me to The gentleman looked a little curiously at the ragged figure before him So you are a city boy are you? Yes sir said Dick Ive lived here ever since I was a baby And you know all about the public buildings I suppose? Yes sir And the Central Park? Yes sir I know my way all round The gentleman looked thoughtful I dont know what to say Frank he remarked after a while It is rather a novel proposal He isnt exactly the sort of guide I would have picked out for you Still he looks honest He has an open face and I think can be depended upon I wish he wasnt so ragged and dirty said Frank who felt a little shy about being seen with such a companion Im afraid you havent washed your face this morning said Mr Whitney for that was the gentlemans name They didnt have no wash-bowls at the hotel where I stopped said Dick What hotel did you stop at? The Box Hotel The Box Hotel? Yes sir I slept in a box on Spruce Street Frank surveyed Dick curiously How did you like it? he asked I slept bully Suppose it had rained Then Id have wet my best clothes said Dick Are these all the clothes you have? Yes sir Mr Whitney spoke a few words to Frank who seemed pleased with the suggestion Follow me my lad he said Dick in some surprise obeyed orders following Mr Whitney and Frank into the hotel past the office to the foot of the staircase Here a servant of the hotel stopped Dick but Mr Whitney explained that he had something for him to do and he was allowed to proceed They entered a long entry and finally paused before a door This being opened a pleasant chamber was disclosed Come in my lad said Mr Whitney Dick and Frank entered CHAPTER IV DICKS NEW SUIT Now said Mr Whitney to Dick my nephew here is on his way to a boarding-school He has a suit of clothes in his trunk about half worn He is willing to give them to you I think they will look better than those you have on Dick was so astonished that he hardly knew what to say Presents were something that he knew very little about never having received any to his knowledge That so large a gift should be made to him by a stranger seemed very wonderful The clothes were brought out and turned out to be a neat gray suit Before you put them on my lad you must wash yourself Clean clothes and a dirty skin dont go very well together Frank you may attend to him I am obliged to go at once Have you got as much money as you require? Yes uncle One more word my lad said Mr Whitney addressing Dick; I may be rash in trusting a boy of whom I know nothing but I like your looks and I think you will prove a proper guide for my nephew Yes I will sir said Dick earnestly Honor bright! Very well A pleasant time to you The process of cleansing commenced To tell the truth Dick needed it and the sensation of cleanliness he found both new and pleasant Frank added to his gift a shirt stockings and an old pair of shoes I am sorry I havent any cap said he Ive got one said Dick It isnt so new as it might be said Frank surveying an old felt hat which had once been black but was now dingy with a large hole in the top and a portion of the rim torn off No said Dick; my grandfather used to wear it when he was a boy and Ive kep it ever since out of respect for his memory But Ill get a new one now I can buy one cheap on Chatham Street Is that near here? Only five minutes walk Then we can get one on the way When Dick was dressed in his new attire with his face and hands clean and his hair brushed it was difficult to imagine that he was the same boy He now looked quite handsome and might readily have been taken for a young gentleman except that his hands were red and grimy Look at yourself said Frank leading him before the mirror By gracious! said Dick starting back in astonishment that isnt me is it? Dont you know yourself? asked Frank smiling It reminds me of Cinderella said Dick when she was changed into a fairy princess I see it one night at Barnums Whatll Johnny Nolan say when he sees me? He wont dare to speak to such a young swell as I be now Aint it rich? and Dick burst into a loud laugh His fancy was tickled by the anticipation of his friends surprise Then the thought of the valuable gifts he had received occurred to him and he looked gratefully at Frank Youre a brick he said A what? A brick! Youre a jolly good fellow to give me such a present Youre quite welcome Dick said Frank kindly Im better off than you are and I can spare the clothes just as well as not You must have a new hat though But that we can get when we go out The old clothes you can make into a bundle Wait a minute till I get my handkercher and Dick pulled from the pocket of the pants a dirty rag which might have been white once though it did not look like it and had apparently once formed a part of a sheet or shirt You mustnt carry that said Frank But Ive got a cold said Dick Oh I dont mean you to go without a handkerchief Ill give you one Frank opened his trunk and pulled out two which he gave to Dick I wonder if I aint dreamin said Dick once more surveying himself doubtfully in the glass Im afraid Im dreamin and shall wake up in a barrel as I did night afore last Shall I pinch you so you can wake here? asked Frank playfully Yes said Dick seriously I wish you would He pulled up the sleeve of his jacket and Frank pinched him pretty hard so that Dick winced Yes I guess Im awake said Dick; youve got a pair of nippers you have But what shall I do with my brush and blacking? he asked You can leave them here till we come back said Frank They will be safe Hold on a minute said Dick surveying Franks boots with a professional eye you aint got a good shine on them boots Ill make em shine so you can see your face in em And he was as good as his word Thank you said Frank; now you had better brush your own shoes This had not occurred to Dick for in general the professional boot-black considers his blacking too valuable to expend on his own shoes or boots if he is fortunate enough to possess a pair The two boys now went downstairs together They met the same servant who had spoken to Dick a few minutes before but there was no recognition He dont know me said Dick He thinks Im a young swell like you Whats a swell? Oh a feller that wears nobby clothes like you And you too Dick Yes said Dick whod ever have thought as I should have turned into a swell? They had now got out on Broadway and were slowly walking along the west side by the Park when who should Dick see in front of him but Johnny Nolan? Instantly Dick was seized with a fancy for witnessing Johnnys amazement at his change in appearance He stole up behind him and struck him on the back Hallo Johnny how many shines have you had? Johnny turned round expecting to see Dick whose voice he recognized but his astonished eyes rested on a nicely dressed boy (the hat alone excepted) who looked indeed like Dick but so transformed in dress that it was difficult to be sure of his identity What luck Johnny? repeated Dick Johnny surveyed him from head to foot in great bewilderment Who be you? he said Well thats a good one laughed Dick; so you dont know Dick? Whered you get all them clothes? asked Johnny Have you been stealin? Say that again and Ill lick you No Ive lent my clothes to a young feller as was goin to a party and didnt have none fit to wear and so I put on my second-best for a change Without deigning any further explanation Dick went off followed by the astonished gaze of Johnny Nolan who could not quite make up his mind whether the neat-looking boy he had been talking with was really Ragged Dick or not In order to reach Chatham Street it was necessary to cross Broadway This was easier proposed than done There is always such a throng of omnibuses drays carriages and vehicles of all kinds in the neighborhood of the Astor House that the crossing is formidable to one who is not used to it Dick made nothing of it dodging in and out among the horses and wagons with perfect self-possession Reaching the opposite sidewalk he looked back and found that Frank had retreated in dismay and that the width of the street was between them Come across! called out Dick I dont see any chance said Frank looking anxiously at the prospect before him Im afraid of being run over If you are you can sue em for damages said Dick Finally Frank got safely over after several narrow escapes as he considered them Is it always so crowded? he asked A good deal worse sometimes said Dick I knowed a young man once who waited six hours for a chance to cross and at last got run over by an omnibus leaving a widder and a large family of orphan children His widder a beautiful young woman was obliged to start a peanut and apple stand There she is now Where? Dick pointed to a hideous old woman of large proportions wearing a bonnet of immense size who presided over an apple-stand close by Frank laughed If that is the case he said I think I will patronize her Leave it to me said Dick winking He advanced gravely to the apple-stand and said Old lady have you paid your taxes? The astonished woman opened her eyes Im a govment officer said Dick sent by the mayor to collect your taxes Ill take it in apples just to oblige That big red one will about pay what youre owin to the govment I dont know nothing about no taxes said the old woman in bewilderment Then said Dick Ill let you off this time Give us two of your best apples and my friend here the President of the Common Council will pay you Frank smiling paid three cents apiece for the apples and they sauntered on Dick remarking If these apples aint good old lady well return em and get our money back This would have been rather difficult in his case as the apple was already half consumed Chatham Street where they wished to go being on the East side the two boys crossed the Park This is an enclosure of about ten acres which years ago was covered with a green sward but is now a great thoroughfare for pedestrians and contains several important public buildings Dick pointed out the City Hall the Hall of Records and the Rotunda The former is a white building of large size and surmounted by a cupola Thats where the mayors office is said Dick Him and me are very good friends I once blacked his boots by particlar appointment Thats the way I pay my city taxes CHAPTER V CHATHAM STREET AND BROADWAY They were soon in Chatham Street walking between rows of ready-made clothing shops many of which had half their stock in trade exposed on the sidewalk The proprietors of these establishments stood at the doors watching attentively the passersby extending urgent invitations to any who even glanced at the goods to enter Walk in young gentlemen said a stout man at the entrance of one shop No I thank you replied Dick as the fly said to the spider Were selling off at less than cost Of course you be Thats where you makes your money said Dick There aint nobody of any enterprise that pretends to make any profit on his goods The Chatham Street trader looked after our hero as if he didnt quite comprehend him; but Dick without waiting for a reply passed on with his companion In some of the shops auctions seemed to be going on I am only offered two dollars gentlemen for this elegant pair of doeskin pants made of the very best of cloth Its a frightful sacrifice Wholl give an eighth? Thank you sir Only seventeen shillings! Why the cloth cost more by the yard! This speaker was standing on a little platform haranguing to three men holding in his hand meanwhile a pair of pants very loose in the legs and presenting a cheap Bowery look Frank and Dick paused before the shop door and finally saw them knocked down to rather a verdant-looking individual at three dollars Clothes seem to be pretty cheap here said Frank Yes but Baxter Street is the cheapest place Is it? Yes Johnny Nolan got a whole rig-out there last week for a dollar coat cap vest pants and shoes They was very good measure too like my best clothes that I took off to oblige you I shall know where to come for clothes next time said Frank laughing I had no idea the city was so much cheaper than the country I suppose the Baxter Street tailors are fashionable? In course they are Me and Horace Greeley always go there for clothes When Horace gets a new suit I always have one made just like it; but I cant go the white hat It aint becomin to my style of beauty A little farther on a man was standing out on the sidewalk distributing small printed handbills One was handed to Frank which he read as follows GRAND CLOSING-OUT SALE! A variety of Beautiful and Costly Articles for Sale at a Dollar apiece Unparalleled Inducements! Walk in Gentlemen! Whereabouts is this sale? asked Frank In here young gentlemen said a black-whiskered individual who appeared suddenly on the scene Walk in Shall we go in Dick? Its a swindlin shop said Dick in a low voice Ive been there That mans a regular cheat Hes seen me before but he dont know me coz of my clothes Step in and see the articles said the man persuasively You neednt buy you know Are all the articles worth moren a dollar? asked Dick Yes said the other and some worth a great deal more Such as what? Well theres a silver pitcher worth twenty dollars And you sell it for a dollar Thats very kind of you said Dick innocently Walk in and youll understand it No I guess not said Dick My servants is so dishonest that I wouldnt like to trust em with a silver pitcher Come along Frank I hope youll succeed in your charitable enterprise of supplyin the public with silver pitchers at nineteen dollars less than they are worth How does he manage Dick? asked Frank as they went on All his articles are numbered and he makes you pay a dollar and then shakes some dice and whatever the figgers come to is the number of the article you draw Most of em aint worth sixpence A hat and cap store being close at hand Dick and Frank went in For seventy-five cents which Frank insisted on paying Dick succeeded in getting quite a neat-looking cap which corresponded much better with his appearance than the one he had on The last not being considered worth keeping Dick dropped on the sidewalk from which on looking back he saw it picked up by a brother boot-black who appeared to consider it better than his own They retraced their steps and went up Chambers Street to Broadway At the corner of Broadway and Chambers Street is a large white marble warehouse which attracted Franks attention What building is that? he asked with interest That belongs to my friend A T Stewart said Dick Its the biggest store on Broadway* If I ever retire from boot-blackin and go into mercantile pursuits I may buy him out or build another store thatll take the shine off this one * Mr Stewarts Tenth Street store was not open at the time Dick spoke Were you ever in the store? asked Frank No said Dick; but Im intimate with one of Stewarts partners He is a cash boy and does nothing but take money all day A very agreeable employment said Frank laughing Yes said Dick Id like to be in it The boys crossed to the West side of Broadway and walked slowly up the street To Frank it was a very interesting spectacle Accustomed to the quiet of the country there was something fascinating in the crowds of people thronging the sidewalks and the great variety of vehicles constantly passing and repassing in the street Then again the shop-windows with their multifarious contents interested and amused him and he was constantly checking Dick to look in at some well-stocked window I dont see how so many shopkeepers can find people enough to buy of them he said We havent got but two stores in our village and Broadway seems to be full of them Yes said Dick; and its pretty much the same in the avenoos specially the Third Sixth and Eighth avenoos The Bowery too is a great place for shoppin There everybody sells cheapern anybody else and nobody pretends to make no profit on their goods Wheres Barnums Museum? asked Frank Oh thats down nearly opposite the Astor House said Dick Didnt you see a great building with lots of flags? Yes Well thats Barnums* Thats where the Happy Family live and the lions and bears and curiosities generally Its a tip-top place Havent you ever been there? Its most as good as the Old Bowery only the plays isnt quite so excitin * Since destroyed by fire and rebuilt farther up Broadway and again burned down in February Ill go if I get time said Frank There is a boy at home who came to New York a month ago and went to Barnums and has been talking about it ever since so I suppose it must be worth seeing Theyve got a great play at the Old Bowery now pursued Dick Tis called the Demon of the Danube The Demon falls in love with a young woman and drags her by the hair up to the top of a steep rock where his castle stands Thats a queer way of showing his love said Frank laughing She didnt want to go with him you know but was in love with another chap When he heard about his girl bein carried off he felt awful and swore an oath not to rest till he had got her free Well at last he got into the castle by some underground passage and he and the Demon had a fight Oh it was bully seein em roll round on the stage cuttin and slashin at each other And which got the best of it? At first the Demon seemed to be ahead but at last the young Baron got him down and struck a dagger into his heart sayin Die false and perjured villain! The dogs shall feast upon thy carcass! and then the Demon give an awful howl and died Then the Baron seized his body and threw it over the precipice It seems to me the actor who plays the Demon ought to get extra pay if he has to be treated that way Thats so said Dick; but I guess hes used to it It seems to agree with his constitution What building is that? asked Frank pointing to a structure several rods back from the street with a large yard in front It was an unusual sight for Broadway all the other buildings in that neighborhood being even with the street That is the New York Hospital said Dick Theyre a rich institution and take care of sick people on very reasonable terms Did you ever go in there? Yes said Dick; there was a friend of mine Johnny Mullen he was a newsboy got run over by a omnibus as he was crossin Broadway down near Park Place He was carried to the Hospital and me and some of his friends paid his board while he was there It was only three dollars a week which was very cheap considerin all the care they took of him I got leave to come and see him while he was here Everything looked so nice and comfortable that I thought a little of coaxin a omnibus driver to run over me so I might go there too Did your friend have to have his leg cut off? asked Frank interested No said Dick; though there was a young student there that was very anxious to have it cut off; but it wasnt done and Johnny is around the streets as well as ever While this conversation was going on they reached No 365 at the corner of Franklin Street* * Now the office of the Merchants Union Express Company Thats Taylors Saloon said Dick When I come into a fortun I shall take my meals there reglar I have heard of it very often said Frank It is said to be very elegant Suppose we go in and take an ice-cream It will give us a chance to see it to better advantage Thank you said Dick; I think thats the most agreeable way of seein the place myself The boys entered and found themselves in a spacious and elegant saloon resplendent with gilding and adorned on all sides by costly mirrors They sat down to a small table with a marble top and Frank gave the order It reminds me of Aladdins palace said Frank looking about him Does it? said Dick; he must have had plenty of money He had an old lamp which he had only to rub when the Slave of the Lamp would appear and do whatever he wanted That must have been a valooable lamp Id be willin to give all my Erie shares for it There was a tall gaunt individual at the next table who apparently heard this last remark of Dicks Turning towards our hero he said May I inquire young man whether you are largely interested in this Erie Railroad? I havent got no property except whats invested in Erie said Dick with a comical side-glance at Frank Indeed! I suppose the investment was made by your guardian No said Dick; I manage my property myself And I presume your dividends have not been large? Why no said Dick; youre about right there They havent As I supposed Its poor stock Now my young friend I can recommend a much better investment which will yield you a large annual income I am agent of the Excelsior Copper Mining Company which possesses one of the most productive mines in the world Its sure to yield fifty per cent on the investment Now all you have to do is to sell out your Erie shares and invest in our stock and Ill insure you a fortune in three years How many shares did you say you had? I didnt say that I remember said Dick Your offer is very kind and obligin and as soon as I get time Ill see about it I hope you will said the stranger Permit me to give you my card Samuel Snap No Wall Street I shall be most happy to receive a call from you and exhibit the maps of our mine I should be glad to have you mention the matter also to your friends I am confident you could do no greater service than to induce them to embark in our enterprise Very good said Dick Here the stranger left the table and walked up to the desk to settle his bill You see what it is to be a man of fortun Frank said Dick and wear good clothes I wonder what that chapll say when he sees me blackin boots to-morrow in the street? Perhaps you earn your money more honorably than he does after all said Frank Some of these mining companies are nothing but swindles got up to cheat people out of their money Hes welcome to all he gets out of me said Dick CHAPTER VI UP BROADWAY TO MADISON SQUARE As the boys pursued their way up Broadway Dick pointed out the prominent hotels and places of amusement Frank was particularly struck with the imposing fronts of the St Nicholas and Metropolitan Hotels the former of white marble the latter of a subdued brown hue but not less elegant in its internal appointments He was not surprised to be informed that each of these splendid structures cost with the furnishing not far from a million dollars At Eighth Street Dick turned to the right and pointed out the Clinton Hall Building now occupied by the Mercantile Library comprising at that time over fifty thousand volumes* * Now not far from one hundred thousand A little farther on they came to a large building standing by itself just at the opening of Third and Fourth Avenues and with one side on each What is that building? asked Frank Thats the Cooper Institute said Dick; built by Mr Cooper a particular friend of mine Me and Peter Cooper used to go to school together What is there inside? asked Frank Theres a hall for public meetins and lectures in the basement and a readin room and a picture gallery up above said Dick Directly opposite Cooper Institute Frank saw a very large building of brick covering about an acre of ground Is that a hotel? he asked No said Dick; thats the Bible House Its the place where they make Bibles I was in there once saw a big pile of em Did you ever read the Bible? asked Frank who had some idea of the neglected state of Dicks education No said Dick; Ive heard its a good book but I never read one I aint much on readin It makes my head ache I suppose you cant read very fast I can read the little words pretty well but the big ones is what stick me If I lived in the city you might come every evening to me and I would teach you Would you take so much trouble about me? asked Dick earnestly Certainly; I should like to see you getting on There isnt much chance of that if you dont know how to read and write Youre a good feller said Dick gratefully I wish you did live in New York Id like to know somethin Whereabouts do you live? About fifty miles off in a town on the left bank of the Hudson I wish youd come up and see me sometime I would like to have you come and stop two or three days Honor bright? I dont understand Do you mean it? asked Dick incredulously Of course I do Why shouldnt I? What would your folks say if they knowed you asked a boot-black to visit you? You are none the worse for being a boot-black Dick I aint used to genteel society said Dick I shouldnt know how to behave Then I could show you You wont be a boot-black all your life you know No said Dick; Im goin to knock off when I get to be ninety Before that I hope said Frank smiling I really wish I could get somethin else to do said Dick soberly Id like to be a office boy and learn business and grow up spectable Why dont you try and see if you cant get a place Dick? Whod take Ragged Dick? But you aint ragged now Dick No said Dick; I look a little better than I did in my Washington coat and Louis Napoleon pants But if I got in a office they wouldnt give me moren three dollars a week and I couldnt live spectable on that No I suppose not said Frank thoughtfully But you would get more at the end of the first year Yes said Dick; but by that time Id be nothin but skin and bones Frank laughed That reminds me he said of the story of an Irishman who out of economy thought he would teach his horse to feed on shavings So he provided the horse with a pair of green spectacles which made the shavings look eatable But unfortunately just as the horse got learned he up and died The hoss must have been a fine specimen of architectur by the time he got through remarked Dick Whereabouts are we now? asked Frank as they emerged from Fourth Avenue into Union Square That is Union Park said Dick pointing to a beautiful enclosure in the centre of which was a pond with a fountain playing Is that the statue of General Washington? asked Frank pointing to a bronze equestrian statue on a granite pedestal Yes said Dick; hes growed some since he was President If hed been as tall as that when he fit in the Revolution hed have walloped the Britishers some I reckon Frank looked up at the statue which is fourteen and a half feet high and acknowledged the justice of Dicks remark How about the coat Dick? he asked Would it fit you? Well it might be rather loose said Dick I aint much moren ten feet high with my boots off No I should think not said Frank smiling Youre a queer boy Dick Well Ive been brought up queer Some boys is born with a silver spoon in their mouth Victorias boys is born with a gold spoon set with dimonds; but gold and silver was scarce when I was born and mine was pewter Perhaps the gold and silver will come by and by Dick Did you ever hear of Dick Whittington? Never did Was he a Ragged Dick? I shouldnt wonder if he was At any rate he was very poor when he was a boy but he didnt stay so Before he died he became Lord Mayor of London Did he? asked Dick looking interested How did he do it? Why you see a rich merchant took pity on him and gave him a home in his own house where he used to stay with the servants being employed in little errands One day the merchant noticed Dick picking up pins and needles that had been dropped and asked him why he did it Dick told him he was going to sell them when he got enough The merchant was pleased with his saving disposition and when soon after he was going to send a vessel to foreign parts he told Dick he might send anything he pleased in it and it should be sold to his advantage Now Dick had nothing in the world but a kitten which had been given him a short time before How much taxes did he have to pay on it? asked Dick Not very high probably But having only the kitten he concluded to send it along After sailing a good many months during which the kitten grew up to be a strong cat the ship touched at an island never before known which happened to be infested with rats and mice to such an extent that they worried everybodys life out and even ransacked the kings palace To make a long story short the captain seeing how matters stood brought Dicks cat ashore and she soon made the rats and mice scatter The king was highly delighted when he saw what havoc she made among the rats and mice and resolved to have her at any price So he offered a great quantity of gold for her which of course the captain was glad to accept It was faithfully carried back to Dick and laid the foundation of his fortune He prospered as he grew up and in time became a very rich merchant respected by all and before he died was elected Lord Mayor of London Thats a pretty good story said Dick; but I dont believe all the cats in New York will ever make me mayor No probably not but you may rise in some other way A good many distinguished men have once been poor boys Theres hope for you Dick if youll try Nobody ever talked to me so before said Dick They just called me Ragged Dick and told me Id grow up to be a vagabone (boys who are better educated need not be surprised at Dicks blunders) and come to the gallows Telling you so wont make it turn out so Dick If youll try to be somebody and grow up into a respectable member of society you will You may not become rich it isnt everybody that becomes rich you know but you can obtain a good position and be respected Ill try said Dick earnestly I neednt have been Ragged Dick so long if I hadnt spent my money in goin to the theatre and treatin boys to oyster-stews and bettin money on cards and such like Have you lost money that way? Lots of it One time I saved up five dollars to buy me a new rig-out cos my best suit was all in rags when Limpy Jim wanted me to play a game with him Limpy Jim? said Frank interrogatively Yes hes lame; thats what makes us call him Limpy Jim I suppose you lost? Yes I lost every penny and had to sleep out cos I hadnt a cent to pay for lodgin Twas a awful cold night and I got most froze Wouldnt Jim let you have any of the money he had won to pay for a lodging? No; I axed him for five cents but he wouldnt let me have it Can you get lodging for five cents? asked Frank in surprise Yes said Dick but not at the Fifth Avenue Hotel Thats it right out there CHAPTER VII THE POCKET-BOOK They had reached the junction of Broadway and of Fifth Avenue Before them was a beautiful park of ten acres On the left-hand side was a large marble building presenting a fine appearance with its extensive white front This was the building at which Dick pointed Is that the Fifth Avenue Hotel? asked Frank Ive heard of it often My Uncle William always stops there when he comes to New York I once slept on the outside of it said Dick They was very reasonable in their charges and told me I might come again Perhaps sometime youll be able to sleep inside said Frank I guess thatll be when Queen Victoria goes to the Five Points to live It looks like a palace said Frank The queen neednt be ashamed to live in such a beautiful building as that Though Frank did not know it one of the queens palaces is far from being as fine a looking building as the Fifth Avenue Hotel St James Palace is a very ugly-looking brick structure and appears much more like a factory than like the home of royalty There are few hotels in the world as fine-looking as this democratic institution At that moment a gentleman passed them on the sidewalk who looked back at Dick as if his face seemed familiar I know that man said Dick after he had passed Hes one of my customers What is his name? I dont know He looked back as if he thought he knew you He would have knowed me at once if it hadnt been for my new clothes said Dick I dont look much like Ragged Dick now I suppose your face looked familiar All but the dirt said Dick laughing I dont always have the chance of washing my face and hands in the Astor House You told me said Frank that there was a place where you could get lodging for five cents Wheres that? Its the News-boys Lodgin House on Fulton Street said Dick up over the Sun office Its a good place I dont know what us boys would do without it They give you supper for six cents and a bed for five cents more I suppose some boys dont even have the five cents to pay do they? Theyll trust the boys said Dick But I dont like to get trusted Id be ashamed to get trusted for five cents or ten either One night I was comin down Chatham Street with fifty cents in my pocket I was goin to get a good oyster-stew and then go to the lodgin house; but somehow it slipped through a hole in my trowses-pocket and I hadnt a cent left If it had been summer I shouldnt have cared but its rather tough stayin out winter nights Frank who had always possessed a good home of his own found it hard to realize that the boy who was walking at his side had actually walked the streets in the cold without a home or money to procure the common comfort of a bed What did you do? he asked his voice full of sympathy I went to the Times office I knowed one of the pressmen and he let me set down in a corner where I was warm and I soon got fast asleep Why dont you get a room somewhere and so always have a home to go to? I dunno said Dick I never thought of it Prhaps I may hire a furnished house on Madison Square Thats where Flora McFlimsey lived I dont know her said Dick who had never read the popular poem of which she is the heroine While this conversation was going on they had turned into Twenty-fifth Street and had by this time reached Third Avenue Just before entering it their attention was drawn to the rather singular conduct of an individual in front of them Stopping suddenly he appeared to pick up something from the sidewalk and then looked about him in rather a confused way I know his game whispered Dick Come along and youll see what it is He hurried Frank forward until they overtook the man who had come to a stand-still Have you found anything? asked Dick Yes said the man Ive found this He exhibited a wallet which seemed stuffed with bills to judge from its plethoric appearance Whew! exclaimed Dick; youre in luck I suppose somebody has lost it said the man and will offer a handsome reward Which youll get Unfortunately I am obliged to take the next train to Boston Thats where I live I havent time to hunt up the owner Then I suppose youll take the pocket-book with you said Dick with assumed simplicity I should like to leave it with some honest fellow who would see it returned to the owner said the man glancing at the boys Im honest said Dick Ive no doubt of it said the other Well young man Ill make you an offer You take the pocket-book All right Hand it over then Wait a minute There must be a large sum inside I shouldnt wonder if there might be a thousand dollars The owner will probably give you a hundred dollars reward Why dont you stay and get it? asked Frank I would only there is sickness in my family and I must get home as soon as possible Just give me twenty dollars and Ill hand you the pocket-book and let you make whatever you can out of it Come thats a good offer What do you say? Dick was well dressed so that the other did not regard it as at all improbable that he might possess that sum He was prepared however to let him have it for less if necessary Twenty dollars is a good deal of money said Dick appearing to hesitate Youll get it back and a good deal more said the stranger persuasively I dont know but I shall What would you do Frank? I dont know but I would said Frank if youve got the money He was not a little surprised to think that Dick had so much by him I dont know but I will said Dick after some irresolution I guess I wont lose much You cant lose anything said the stranger briskly Only be quick for I must be on my way to the cars I am afraid I shall miss them now Dick pulled out a bill from his pocket and handed it to the stranger receiving the pocket-book in return At that moment a policeman turned the corner and the stranger hurriedly thrusting the bill into his pocket without looking at it made off with rapid steps What is there in the pocket-book Dick? asked Frank in some excitement I hope theres enough to pay you for the money you gave him Dick laughed Ill risk that said he But you gave him twenty dollars Thats a good deal of money If I had given him as much as that I should deserve to be cheated out of it But you did didnt you? He thought so What was it then? It was nothing but a dry-goods circular got up to imitate a bank-bill Frank looked sober You ought not to have cheated him Dick he said reproachfully Didnt he want to cheat me? I dont know What do you spose there is in that pocket-book? asked Dick holding it up Frank surveyed its ample proportions and answered sincerely enough Money and a good deal of it There aint stamps enough in it to buy a oyster-stew said Dick If you dont believe it just look while I open it So saying he opened the pocket-book and showed Frank that it was stuffed out with pieces of blank paper carefully folded up in the shape of bills Frank who was unused to city life and had never heard anything of the drop-game looked amazed at this unexpected development I knowed how it was all the time said Dick I guess I got the best of him there This wallets worth somethin I shall use it to keep my stiffkits of Erie stock in and all my other papers what aint of no use to anybody but the owner Thats the kind of papers its got in it now said Frank smiling Thats so! said Dick By hokey! he exclaimed suddenly if there aint the old chap comin back agin He looks as if hed heard bad news from his sick family By this time the pocket-book dropper had come up Approaching the boys he said in an undertone to Dick Give me back that pocket-book you young rascal! Beg your pardon mister said Dick but was you addressin me? Yes I was Cause you called me by the wrong name Ive knowed some rascals but I aint the honor to belong to the family He looked significantly at the other as he spoke which didnt improve the mans temper Accustomed to swindle others he did not fancy being practised upon in return Give me back that pocket-book he repeated in a threatening voice Couldnt do it said Dick coolly Im gon to restore it to the owner The contents is so valooable that most likely the loss has made him sick and hell be likely to come down liberal to the honest finder You gave me a bogus bill said the man Its what I use myself said Dick Youve swindled me I thought it was the other way None of your nonsense said the man angrily If you dont give up that pocket-book Ill call a policeman I wish you would said Dick Theyll know most likely whether its Stewart or Astor thats lost the pocket-book and I can get em to return it The dropper whose object it was to recover the pocket-book in order to try the same game on a more satisfactory customer was irritated by Dicks refusal and above all by the coolness he displayed He resolved to make one more attempt Do you want to pass the night in the Tombs? he asked Thank you for your very obligin proposal said Dick; but it aint convenient to-day Any other time when youd like to have me come and stop with you Im agreeable; but my two youngest children is down with the measles and I expect Ill have to set up all night to take care of em Is the Tombs in gineral a pleasant place of residence? Dick asked this question with an air of so much earnestness that Frank could scarcely forbear laughing though it is hardly necessary to say that the dropper was by no means so inclined Youll know sometime he said scowling Ill make you a fair offer said Dick If I get moren fifty dollars as a reward for my honesty Ill divide with you But I say aint it most time to go back to your sick family in Boston? Finding that nothing was to be made out of Dick the man strode away with a muttered curse You were too smart for him Dick said Frank Yes said Dick I aint knocked round the city streets all my life for nothin CHAPTER VIII DICKS EARLY HISTORY Have you always lived in New York Dick? asked Frank after a pause Ever since I can remember I wish youd tell me a little about yourself Have you got any father or mother? I aint got no mother She died when I wasnt but three years old My father went to sea; but he went off before mother died and nothin was ever heard of him I expect he got wrecked or died at sea And what became of you when your mother died? The folks she boarded with took care of me but they was poor and they couldnt do much When I was seven the woman died and her husband went out West and then I had to scratch for myself At seven years old! exclaimed Frank in amazement Yes said Dick I was a little feller to take care of myself but he continued with pardonable pride I did it What could you do? Sometimes one thing and sometimes another said Dick I changed my business accordin as I had to Sometimes I was a newsboy and diffused intelligence among the masses as I heard somebody say once in a big speech he made in the Park Them was the times when Horace Greeley and James Gordon Bennett made money Through your enterprise? suggested Frank Yes said Dick; but I give it up after a while What for? Well they didnt always put news enough in their papers and people wouldnt buy em as fast as I wanted em to So one mornin I was stuck on a lot of Heralds and I thought Id make a sensation So I called out GREAT NEWS! QUEEN VICTORIA ASSASSINATED! All my Heralds went off like hot cakes and I went off too but one of the gentlemen what got sold remembered me and said hed have me took up and thats what made me change my business That wasnt right Dick said Frank I know it said Dick; but lots of boys does it That dont make it any better No said Dick I was sort of ashamed at the time specially about one poor old gentleman a Englishman he was He couldnt help cryin to think the queen was dead and his hands shook when he handed me the money for the paper What did you do next? I went into the match business said Dick; but it was small sales and small profits Most of the people I called on had just laid in a stock and didnt want to buy So one cold night when I hadnt money enough to pay for a lodgin I burned the last of my matches to keep me from freezin But it cost too much to get warm that way and I couldnt keep it up Youve seen hard times Dick said Frank compassionately Yes said Dick Ive knowed what it was to be hungry and cold with nothin to eat or to warm me; but theres one thing I never could do he added proudly Whats that? I never stole said Dick Its mean and I wouldnt do it Were you ever tempted to? Lots of times Once I had been goin round all day and hadnt sold any matches except three cents worth early in the mornin With that I bought an apple thinkin I should get some more bimeby When evenin come I was awful hungry I went into a bakers just to look at the bread It made me feel kind o good just to look at the bread and cakes and I thought maybe they would give me some I asked em wouldnt they give me a loaf and take their pay in matches But they said theyd got enough matches to last three months; so there wasnt any chance for a trade While I was standin at the stove warmin me the baker went into a back room and I felt so hungry I thought I would take just one loaf and go off with it There was such a big pile I dont think hed have known it But you didnt do it? No I didnt and I was glad of it for when the man came in agin he said he wanted some one to carry some cake to a lady in St Marks Place His boy was sick and he hadnt no one to send; so he told me hed give me ten cents if I would go My business wasnt very pressin just then so I went and when I come back I took my pay in bread and cakes Didnt they taste good though? So you didnt stay long in the match business Dick? No I couldnt sell enough to make it pay Then there was some folks that wanted me to sell cheaper to them; so I couldnt make any profit There was one old lady she was rich too for she lived in a big brick house beat me down so that I didnt make no profit at all; but she wouldnt buy without and I hadnt sold none that day; so I let her have them I dont see why rich folks should be so hard upon a poor boy that wants to make a livin Theres a good deal of meanness in the world Im afraid Dick If everybody was like you and your uncle said Dick there would be some chance for poor people If I was rich Id try to help em along Perhaps you will be rich sometime Dick Dick shook his head Im afraid all my wallets will be like this said Dick indicating the one he had received from the dropper and will be full of papers what aint of no use to anybody except the owner That depends very much on yourself Dick said Frank Stewart wasnt always rich you know Wasnt he? When he first came to New York as a young man he was a teacher and teachers are not generally very rich At last he went into business starting in a small way and worked his way up by degrees But there was one thing he determined in the beginning that he would be strictly honorable in all his dealings and never overreach any one for the sake of making money If there was a chance for him Dick there is a chance for you He knowed enough to be a teacher and Im awful ignorant said Dick But you neednt stay so How can I help it? Cant you learn at school? I cant go to school cause Ive got my livin to earn It wouldnt do me much good if I learned to read and write and just as Id got learned I starved to death But are there no night-schools? Yes Why dont you go? I suppose you dont work in the evenings I never cared much about it said Dick and thats the truth But since Ive got to talkin with you I think more about it I guess Ill begin to go I wish you would Dick Youll make a smart man if you only get a little education Do you think so? asked Dick doubtfully I know so A boy who has earned his own living since he was seven years old must have something in him I feel very much interested in you Dick Youve had a hard time of it so far in life but I think better times are in store I want you to do well and I feel sure you can if you only try Youre a good fellow said Dick gratefully Im afraid Im a pretty rough customer but I aint as bad as some I mean to turn over a new leaf and try to grow up spectable Thereve been a great many boys begin as low down as you Dick that have grown up respectable and honored But they had to work pretty hard for it Im willin to work hard said Dick And you must not only work hard but work in the right way Whats the right way? You began in the right way when you determined never to steal or do anything mean or dishonorable however strongly tempted to do so That will make people have confidence in you when they come to know you But in order to succeed well you must manage to get as good an education as you can Until you do you cannot get a position in an office or counting-room even to run errands Thats so said Dick soberly I never thought how awful ignorant I was till now That can be remedied with perseverance said Frank A year will do a great deal for you Ill go to work and see what I can do said Dick energetically CHAPTER IX A SCENE IN A THIRD AVENUE CAR The boys had turned into Third Avenue a long street which commencing just below the Cooper Institute runs out to Harlem A man came out of a side street uttering at intervals a monotonous cry which sounded like glass puddin Glass pudding! repeated Frank looking in surprised wonder at Dick What does he mean? Perhaps youd like some said Dick I never heard of it before Suppose you ask him what he charges for his puddin Frank looked more narrowly at the man and soon concluded that he was a glazier Oh I understand he said He means glass put in Franks mistake was not a singular one The monotonous cry of these men certainly sounds more like glass puddin than the words they intend to utter Now said Dick where shall we go? I should like to see Central Park said Frank Is it far off? It is about a mile and a half from here said Dick This is Twenty-ninth Street and the Park begins at Fifty-ninth Street It may be explained for the benefit of readers who have never visited New York that about a mile from the City Hall the cross-streets begin to be numbered in regular order There is a continuous line of houses as far as One Hundred and Thirtieth Street where may be found the terminus of the Harlem line of horse-cars When the entire island is laid out and settled probably the numbers will reach two hundred or more Central Park which lies between Fifty-ninth Street on the south and One Hundred and Tenth Street on the north is true to its name occupying about the centre of the island The distance between two parallel streets is called a block and twenty blocks make a mile It will therefore be seen that Dick was exactly right when he said they were a mile and a half from Central Park That is too far to walk said Frank Twont cost but six cents to ride said Dick You mean in the horse-cars? Yes All right then Well jump aboard the next car The Third Avenue and Harlem line of horse-cars is better patronized than any other in New York though not much can be said for the cars which are usually dirty and overcrowded Still when it is considered that only seven cents are charged for the entire distance to Harlem about seven miles from the City Hall the fare can hardly be complained of But of course most of the profit is made from the way-passengers who only ride a short distance A car was at that moment approaching but it seemed pretty crowded Shall we take that or wait for another? asked Frank The nextll most likely be as bad said Dick The boys accordingly signalled to the conductor to stop and got on the front platform They were obliged to stand up till the car reached Fortieth Street when so many of the passengers had got off that they obtained seats Frank sat down beside a middle-aged woman or lady as she probably called herself whose sharp visage and thin lips did not seem to promise a very pleasant disposition When the two gentlemen who sat beside her arose she spread her skirts in the endeavor to fill two seats Disregarding this the boys sat down There aint room for two she said looking sourly at Frank There were two here before Well there ought not to have been Some people like to crowd in where theyre not wanted And some like to take up a double allowance of room thought Frank; but he did not say so He saw that the woman had a bad temper and thought it wisest to say nothing Frank had never ridden up the city as far as this and it was with much interest that he looked out of the car windows at the stores on either side Third Avenue is a broad street but in the character of its houses and stores it is quite inferior to Broadway though better than some of the avenues further east Fifth Avenue as most of my readers already know is the finest street in the city being lined with splendid private residences occupied by the wealthier classes Many of the cross streets also boast houses which may be considered palaces so elegant are they externally and internally Frank caught glimpses of some of these as he was carried towards the Park After the first conversation already mentioned with the lady at his side he supposed he should have nothing further to do with her But in this he was mistaken While he was busy looking out of the car window she plunged her hand into her pocket in search of her purse which she was unable to find Instantly she jumped to the conclusion that it had been stolen and her suspicions fastened upon Frank with whom she was already provoked for crowding her as she termed it Conductor! she exclaimed in a sharp voice Whats wanted maam? returned that functionary I want you to come here right off Whats the matter? My purse has been stolen There was four dollars and eighty cents in it I know because I counted it when I paid my fare Who stole it? That boy she said pointing to Frank who listened to the charge in the most intense astonishment He crowded in here on purpose to rob me and I want you to search him right off Thats a lie! exclaimed Dick indignantly Oh youre in league with him I dare say said the woman spitefully Youre as bad as he is Ill be bound Youre a nice female you be! said Dick ironically Dont you dare to call me a female sir said the lady furiously Why you aint a man in disguise be you? said Dick You are very much mistaken madam said Frank quietly The conductor may search me if you desire it A charge of theft made in a crowded car of course made quite a sensation Cautious passengers instinctively put their hands on their pockets to make sure that they too had not been robbed As for Frank his face flushed and he felt very indignant that he should even be suspected of so mean a crime He had been carefully brought up and been taught to regard stealing as low and wicked Dick on the contrary thought it a capital joke that such a charge should have been made against his companion Though he had brought himself up and known plenty of boys and men too who would steal he had never done so himself He thought it mean But he could not be expected to regard it as Frank did He had been too familiar with it in others to look upon it with horror Meanwhile the passengers rather sided with the boys Appearances go a great ways and Frank did not look like a thief I think you must be mistaken madam said a gentleman sitting opposite The lad does not look as if he would steal You cant tell by looks said the lady sourly Theyre deceitful; villains are generally well dressed Be they? said Dick Youd ought to see me with my Washington coat on Youd think I was the biggest villain ever you saw Ive no doubt you are said the lady scowling in the direction of our hero Thank you maam said Dick Tisnt often I get such fine compliments None of your impudence said the lady wrathfully I believe youre the worst of the two Meanwhile the car had been stopped How long are we going to stop here? demanded a passenger impatiently Im in a hurry if none of the rest of you are I want my pocket-book said the lady defiantly Well maam I havent got it and I dont see as its doing you any good detaining us all here Conductor will you call a policeman to search that young scamp? continued the aggrieved lady You dont expect Im going to lose my money and do nothing about it Ill turn my pockets inside out if you want me to said Frank proudly Theres no need of a policeman The conductor or any one else may search me Well youngster said the conductor if the lady agrees Ill search you The lady signified her assent Frank accordingly turned his pockets inside out but nothing was revealed except his own porte-monnaie and a penknife Well maam are you satisfied? asked the conductor No I aint said she decidedly You dont think hes got it still? No but hes passed it over to his confederate that boy there thats so full of impudence Thats me said Dick comically He confesses it said the lady; I want him searched All right said Dick Im ready for the operation only as Ive got valooable property about me be careful not to drop any of my Erie Bonds The conductors hand forthwith dove into Dicks pocket and drew out a rusty jack-knife a battered cent about fifty cents in change and the capacious pocket-book which he had received from the swindler who was anxious to get back to his sick family in Boston Is that yours maam? asked the conductor holding up the wallet which excited some amazement by its size among the other passengers It seems to me you carry a large pocket-book for a young man of your age said the conductor Thats what I carry my cash and valooable papers in said Dick I suppose that isnt yours maam said the conductor turning to the lady No said she scornfully I wouldnt carry round such a great wallet as that Most likely hes stolen it from somebody else What a prime detective youd be! said Dick Prhaps you know who I took it from I dont know but my moneys in it said the lady sharply Conductor will you open that wallet and see what there is in it? Dont disturb the valooable papers said Dick in a tone of pretended anxiety The contents of the wallet excited some amusement among the passengers There dont seem to be much money here said the conductor taking out a roll of tissue paper cut out in the shape of bills and rolled up No said Dick Didnt I tell you them were papers of no valoo to anybody but the owner? If the ladyd like to borrow I wont charge no interest Where is my money then? said the lady in some discomfiture I shouldnt wonder if one of the young scamps had thrown it out of the window Youd better search your pocket once more said the gentleman opposite I dont believe either of the boys is in fault They dont look to me as if they would steal Thank you sir said Frank The lady followed out the suggestion and plunging her hand once more into her pocket drew out a small porte-monnaie She hardly knew whether to be glad or sorry at this discovery It placed her in rather an awkward position after the fuss she had made and the detention to which she had subjected the passengers now as it proved for nothing Is that the pocket-book you thought stolen? asked the conductor Yes said she rather confusedly Then youve been keeping me waiting all this time for nothing he said sharply I wish youd take care to be sure next time before you make such a disturbance for nothing Ive lost five minutes and shall not be on time I cant help it was the cross reply; I didnt know it was in my pocket It seems to me you owe an apology to the boys you accused of a theft which they have not committed said the gentleman opposite I shant apologize to anybody said the lady whose temper was not of the best; least of all to such whipper-snappers as they are Thank you maam said Dick comically; your handsome apology is accepted It aint of no consequence only I didnt like to expose the contents of my valooable pocket-book for fear it might excite the envy of some of my poor neighbors Youre a character said the gentleman who had already spoken with a smile A bad character! muttered the lady But it was quite evident that the sympathies of those present were against the lady and on the side of the boys who had been falsely accused while Dicks drollery had created considerable amusement The cars had now reached Fifty-ninth Street the southern boundary of the Park and here our hero and his companion got off Youd better look out for pickpockets my lad said the conductor pleasantly That big wallet of yours might prove a great temptation Thats so said Dick Thats the misfortin of being rich Astor and me dont sleep much for fear of burglars breakin in and robbin us of our valooable treasures Sometimes I think Ill give all my money to an Orphan Asylum and take it out in board I guess Id make money by the operation While Dick was speaking the car rolled away and the boys turned up Fifty-ninth Street for two long blocks yet separated them from the Park CHAPTER X INTRODUCES A VICTIM OF MISPLACED CONFIDENCE What a queer chap you are Dick! said Frank laughing You always seem to be in good spirits No I aint always Sometimes I have the blues When? Well once last winter it was awful cold and there was big holes in my shoes and my gloves and all my warm clothes was at the tailors I felt as if life was sort of tough and Id like it if some rich man would adopt me and give me plenty to eat and drink and wear without my havin to look so sharp after it Then agin when Ive seen boys with good homes and fathers and mothers Ive thought Id like to have somebody to care for me Dicks tone changed as he said this from his usual levity and there was a touch of sadness in it Frank blessed with a good home and indulgent parents could not help pitying the friendless boy who had found life such up-hill work Dont say you have no one to care for you Dick he said lightly laying his hand on Dicks shoulder I will care for you Will you? If you will let me I wish you would said Dick earnestly Id like to feel that I have one friend who cares for me Central Park was now before them but it was far from presenting the appearance which it now exhibits It had not been long since work had been commenced upon it and it was still very rough and unfinished A rough tract of land two miles and a half from north to south and a half a mile broad very rocky in parts was the material from which the Park Commissioners have made the present beautiful enclosure There were no houses of good appearance near it buildings being limited mainly to rude temporary huts used by the workmen who were employed in improving it The time will undoubtedly come when the Park will be surrounded by elegant residences and compare favorably in this respect with the most attractive parts of any city in the world But at the time when Frank and Dick visited it not much could be said in favor either of the Park or its neighborhood If this is Central Park said Frank who naturally felt disappointed I dont think much of it My fathers got a large pasture that is much nicer Itll look better some time said Dick There aint much to see now but rocks We will take a walk over it if you want to No said Frank Ive seen as much of it as I want to Besides I feel tired Then well go back We can take the Sixth Avenue cars They will bring us out at Vesey Street just beside the Astor House All right said Frank That will be the best course I hope he added laughing our agreeable lady friend wont be there I dont care about being accused of _stealing_ again She was a tough one said Dick Wouldnt she make a nice wife for a man that likes to live in hot water and didnt mind bein scalded two or three times a day? Yes I think shed just suit him Is that the right car Dick? Yes jump in and Ill follow The Sixth Avenue is lined with stores many of them of very good appearance and would make a very respectable principal street for a good-sized city But it is only one of several long business streets which run up the island and illustrate the extent and importance of the city to which they belong No incidents worth mentioning took place during their ride down town In about three-quarters of an hour the boys got out of the car beside the Astor House Are you goin in now Frank? asked Dick That depends upon whether you have anything else to show me Wouldnt you like to go to Wall Street? Thats the street where there are so many bankers and brokers isnt it? Yes I spose you aint afraid of bulls and bears are you? Bulls and bears? repeated Frank puzzled Yes What are they? The bulls is what tries to make the stocks go up and the bears is what try to growl em down Oh I see Yes Id like to go Accordingly they walked down on the west side of Broadway as far as Trinity Church and then crossing entered a street not very wide or very long but of very great importance The reader would be astonished if he could know the amount of money involved in the transactions which take place in a single day in this street It would be found that although Broadway is much greater in length and lined with stores it stands second to Wall Street in this respect What is that large marble building? asked Frank pointing to a massive structure on the corner of Wall and Nassau Streets It was in the form of a parallelogram two hundred feet long by ninety wide and about eighty feet in height the ascent to the entrance being by eighteen granite steps Thats the Custom House said Dick It looks like pictures Ive seen of the Parthenon at Athens said Frank meditatively Wheres Athens? asked Dick It aint in York State is it? Not the Athens I mean at any rate It is in Greece and was a famous city two thousand years ago Thats longer than I can remember said Dick I cant remember distinctly moren about a thousand years What a chap you are Dick! Do you know if we can go in? The boys ascertained after a little inquiry that they would be allowed to do so They accordingly entered the Custom House and made their way up to the roof from which they had a fine view of the harbor the wharves crowded with shipping and the neighboring shores of Long Island and New Jersey Towards the north they looked down for many miles upon continuous lines of streets and thousands of roofs with here and there a church-spire rising above its neighbors Dick had never before been up there and he as well as Frank was interested in the grand view spread before them At length they descended and were going down the granite steps on the outside of the building when they were addressed by a young man whose appearance is worth describing He was tall and rather loosely put together with small eyes and rather a prominent nose His clothing had evidently not been furnished by a city tailor He wore a blue coat with brass buttons and pantaloons of rather scanty dimensions which were several inches too short to cover his lower limbs He held in his hand a piece of paper and his countenance wore a look of mingled bewilderment and anxiety Be they a-payin out money inside there? he asked indicating the interior by a motion of his hand I guess so said Dick Are you a-goin in for some? Wal yes Ive got an order here for sixty dollars made a kind of speculation this morning How was it? asked Frank Wal you see I brought down some money to put in the bank fifty dollars it was and I hadnt justly made up my mind what bank to put it into when a chap came up in a terrible hurry and said it was very unfortunate but the bank wasnt open and he must have some money right off He was obliged to go out of the city by the next train I asked him how much he wanted He said fifty dollars I told him Id got that and he offered me a check on the bank for sixty and I let him have it I thought that was a pretty easy way to earn ten dollars so I counted out the money and he went off He told me Id hear a bell ring when they began to pay out money But Ive waited most two hours and I haint heard it yet Id ought to be goin for I told dad Id be home to-night Do you think I can get the money now? Will you show me the check? asked Frank who had listened attentively to the countrymans story and suspected that he had been made the victim of a swindler It was made out upon the Washington Bank in the sum of sixty dollars and was signed Ephraim Smith Washington Bank! repeated Frank Dick is there such a bank in the city? Not as I knows on said Dick Leastways I dont own any shares in it Aint this the Washington Bank? asked the countryman pointing to the building on the steps of which the three were now standing No its the Custom House And wont they give me any money for this? asked the young man the perspiration standing on his brow I am afraid the man who gave it to you was a swindler said Frank gently And wont I ever see my fifty dollars again? asked the youth in agony I am afraid not Whatll dad say? ejaculated the miserable youth It makes me feel sick to think of it I wish I had the feller here Id shake him out of his boots What did he look like? Ill call a policeman and you shall describe him Perhaps in that way you can get track of your money Dick called a policeman who listened to the description and recognized the operator as an experienced swindler He assured the countryman that there was very little chance of his ever seeing his money again The boys left the miserable youth loudly bewailing his bad luck and proceeded on their way down the street Hes a baby said Dick contemptuously Hed ought to know how to take care of himself and his money A feller has to look sharp in this city or hell lose his eye-teeth before he knows it I suppose you never got swindled out of fifty dollars Dick? No I dont carry no such small bills I wish I did he added So do I Dick Whats that building there at the end of the street? Thats the Wall-Street Ferry to Brooklyn How long does it take to go across? Not moren five minutes Suppose we just ride over and back All right! said Dick Its rather expensive; but if you dont mind I dont Why how much does it cost? Two cents apiece I guess I can stand that Let us go They passed the gate paying the fare to a man who stood at the entrance and were soon on the ferry-boat bound for Brooklyn They had scarcely entered the boat when Dick grasping Frank by the arm pointed to a man just outside of the gentlemens cabin Do you see that man Frank? he inquired Yes what of him? Hes the man that cheated the country chap out of his fifty dollars CHAPTER XI DICK AS A DETECTIVE Dicks ready identification of the rogue who had cheated the countryman surprised Frank What makes you think it is he? he asked Because Ive seen him before and I know hes up to them kind of tricks When I heard how he looked I was sure I knowed him Our recognizing him wont be of much use said Frank It wont give back the countryman his money I dont know said Dick thoughtfully May be I can get it How? asked Frank incredulously Wait a minute and youll see Dick left his companion and went up to the man whom he suspected Ephraim Smith said Dick in a low voice The man turned suddenly and looked at Dick uneasily What did you say? he asked I believe your name is Ephraim Smith continued Dick Youre mistaken said the man and was about to move off Stop a minute said Dick Dont you keep your money in the Washington Bank? I dont know any such bank Im in a hurry young man and I cant stop to answer any foolish questions The boat had by this time reached the Brooklyn pier and Mr Ephraim Smith seemed in a hurry to land Look here said Dick significantly; youd better not go on shore unless you want to jump into the arms of a policeman What do you mean? asked the man startled That little affair of yours is known to the police said Dick; about how you got fifty dollars out of a greenhorn on a false check and it maynt be safe for you to go ashore I dont know what youre talking about said the swindler with affected boldness though Dick could see that he was ill at ease Yes you do said Dick There isnt but one thing to do Just give me back that money and Ill see that youre not touched If you dont Ill give you up to the first pliceman we meet Dick looked so determined and spoke so confidently that the other overcome by his fears no longer hesitated but passed a roll of bills to Dick and hastily left the boat All this Frank witnessed with great amazement not understanding what influence Dick could have obtained over the swindler sufficient to compel restitution How did you do it? he asked eagerly I told him Id exert my influence with the president to have him tried by _habeas corpus_ said Dick And of course that frightened him But tell me without joking how you managed Dick gave a truthful account of what occurred and then said Now well go back and carry the money Suppose we dont find the poor countryman? Then the plice will take care of it They remained on board the boat and in five minutes were again in New York Going up Wall Street they met the countryman a little distance from the Custom House His face was marked with the traces of deep anguish; but in his case even grief could not subdue the cravings of appetite He had purchased some cakes of one of the old women who spread out for the benefit of passers-by an array of apples and seed-cakes and was munching them with melancholy satisfaction Hilloa! said Dick Have you found your money? No ejaculated the young man with a convulsive gasp I shant ever see it again The mean skunks cheated me out of it Consarn his picter! It took me most six months to save it up I was workin for Deacon Pinkham in our place Oh I wish Id never come to New York! The deacon he told me hed keep it for me; but I wanted to put it in the bank and now its all gone boo hoo! And the miserable youth having despatched his cakes was so overcome by the thought of his loss that he burst into tears I say said Dick dry up and see what Ive got here The youth no sooner saw the roll of bills and comprehended that it was indeed his lost treasure than from the depths of anguish he was exalted to the most ecstatic joy He seized Dicks hand and shook it with so much energy that our hero began to feel rather alarmed for its safety Pears to me you take my arm for a pump-handle said he Couldnt you show your gratitood some other way? Its just possible I may want to use my arm agin some time The young man desisted but invited Dick most cordially to come up and stop a week with him at his country home assuring him that he wouldnt charge him anything for board All right! said Dick If you dont mind Ill bring my wife along too Shes delicate and the country air might do her good Jonathan stared at him in amazement uncertain whether to credit the fact of his marriage Dick walked on with Frank leaving him in an apparent state of stupefaction and it is possible that he has not yet settled the affair to his satisfaction Now said Frank I think Ill go back to the Astor House Uncle has probably got through his business and returned All right said Dick The two boys walked up to Broadway just where the tall steeple of Trinity faces the street of bankers and brokers and walked leisurely to the hotel When they arrived at the Astor House Dick said Good-by Frank Not yet said Frank; I want you to come in with me Dick followed his young patron up the steps Frank went to the reading-room where as he had thought probable he found his uncle already arrived and reading a copy of The Evening Post which he had just purchased outside Well boys he said looking up have you had a pleasant jaunt? Yes sir said Frank Dicks a capital guide So this is Dick said Mr Whitney surveying him with a smile Upon my word I should hardly have known him I must congratulate him on his improved appearance Franks been very kind to me said Dick who rough street-boy as he was had a heart easily touched by kindness of which he had never experienced much Hes a tip-top fellow I believe he is a good boy said Mr Whitney I hope my lad you will prosper and rise in the world You know in this free country poverty in early life is no bar to a mans advancement I havent risen very high myself he added with a smile but have met with moderate success in life; yet there was a time when I was as poor as you Were you sir asked Dick eagerly Yes my boy I have known the time I have been obliged to go without my dinner because I didnt have enough money to pay for it How did you get up in the world asked Dick anxiously I entered a printing-office as an apprentice and worked for some years Then my eyes gave out and I was obliged to give that up Not knowing what else to do I went into the country and worked on a farm After a while I was lucky enough to invent a machine which has brought me in a great deal of money But there was one thing I got while I was in the printing-office which I value more than money What was that sir? A taste for reading and study During my leisure hours I improved myself by study and acquired a large part of the knowledge which I now possess Indeed it was one of my books that first put me on the track of the invention which I afterwards made So you see my lad that my studious habits paid me in money as well as in another way Im awful ignorant said Dick soberly But you are young and I judge a smart boy If you try to learn you can and if you ever expect to do anything in the world you must know something of books I will said Dick resolutely I aint always goin to black boots for a livin All labor is respectable my lad and you have no cause to be ashamed of any honest business; yet when you can get something to do that promises better for your future prospects I advise you to do so Till then earn your living in the way you are accustomed to avoid extravagance and save up a little money if you can Thank you for your advice said our hero There aint many that takes an interest in Ragged Dick So thats your name said Mr Whitney If I judge you rightly it wont be long before you change it Save your money my lad buy books and determine to be somebody and you may yet fill an honorable position Ill try said Dick Good-night sir Wait a minute Dick said Frank Your blacking-box and old clothes are upstairs You may want them In course said Dick I couldnt get along without my best clothes and my stock in trade You may go up to the room with him Frank said Mr Whitney The clerk will give you the key I want to see you Dick before you go Yes sir said Dick Where are you going to sleep to-night Dick? asked Frank as they went upstairs together Praps at the Fifth Avenue Hotel on the outside said Dick Havent you any place to sleep then? I slept in a box last night In a box? Yes on Spruce Street Poor fellow! said Frank compassionately Oh twas a bully bed full of straw! I slept like a top Dont you earn enough to pay for a room Dick? Yes said Dick; only I spend my money foolish goin to the Old Bowery and Tony Pastors and sometimes gamblin in Baxter Street You wont gamble any more will you Dick? said Frank laying his hand persuasively on his companions shoulder No I wont said Dick Youll promise? Yes and Ill keep it Youre a good feller I wish you was goin to be in New York I am going to a boarding-school in Connecticut The name of the town is Barnton Will you write to me Dick? My writing would look like hens tracks said our hero Never mind I want you to write When you write you can tell me how to direct and I will send you a letter I wish you would said Dick I wish I was more like you I hope you will make a much better boy Dick Now well go in to my uncle He wishes to see you before you go They went into the reading-room Dick had wrapped up his blacking-brush in a newspaper with which Frank had supplied him feeling that a guest of the Astor House should hardly be seen coming out of the hotel displaying such a professional sign Uncle Dicks ready to go said Frank Good-by my lad said Mr Whitney I hope to hear good accounts of you sometime Dont forget what I have told you Remember that your future position depends mainly upon yourself and that it will be high or low as you choose to make it He held out his hand in which was a five-dollar bill Dick shrunk back I dont like to take it he said I havent earned it Perhaps not said Mr Whitney; but I give it to you because I remember my own friendless youth I hope it may be of service to you Sometime when you are a prosperous man you can repay it in the form of aid to some poor boy who is struggling upward as you are now I will sir said Dick manfully He no longer refused the money but took it gratefully and bidding Frank and his uncle good-by went out into the street A feeling of loneliness came over him as he left the presence of Frank for whom he had formed a strong attachment in the few hours he had known him CHAPTER XII DICK HIRES A ROOM ON MOTT STREET Going out into the fresh air Dick felt the pangs of hunger He accordingly went to a restaurant and got a substantial supper Perhaps it was the new clothes he wore which made him feel a little more aristocratic At all events instead of patronizing the cheap restaurant where he usually procured his meals he went into the refectory attached to Lovejoys Hotel where the prices were higher and the company more select In his ordinary dress Dick would have been excluded but now he had the appearance of a very respectable gentlemanly boy whose presence would not discredit any establishment His orders were therefore received with attention by the waiter and in due time a good supper was placed before him I wish I could come here every day thought Dick It seems kind o nice and spectable side of the other place Theres a gent at that other table that Ive shined boots for moren once He dont know me in my new clothes Guess he dont know his boot-black patronizes the same establishment His supper over Dick went up to the desk and presenting his check tendered in payment his five-dollar bill as if it were one of a large number which he possessed Receiving back his change he went out into the street Two questions now arose How should he spend the evening and where should he pass the night? Yesterday with such a sum of money in his possession he would have answered both questions readily For the evening he would have passed it at the Old Bowery and gone to sleep in any out-of-the-way place that offered But he had turned over a new leaf or resolved to do so He meant to save his money for some useful purpose to aid his advancement in the world So he could not afford the theatre Besides with his new clothes he was unwilling to pass the night out of doors I should spile em he thought and that wouldnt pay So he determined to hunt up a room which he could occupy regularly and consider as his own where he could sleep nights instead of depending on boxes and old wagons for a chance shelter This would be the first step towards respectability and Dick determined to take it He accordingly passed through the City Hall Park and walked leisurely up Centre Street He decided that it would hardly be advisable for him to seek lodgings in Fifth Avenue although his present cash capital consisted of nearly five dollars in money besides the valuable papers contained in his wallet Besides he had reason to doubt whether any in his line of business lived on that aristocratic street He took his way to Mott Street which is considerably less pretentious and halted in front of a shabby brick lodging-house kept by a Mrs Mooney with whose son Tom Dick was acquainted Dick rang the bell which sent back a shrill metallic response The door was opened by a slatternly servant who looked at him inquiringly and not without curiosity It must be remembered that Dick was well dressed and that nothing in his appearance bespoke his occupation Being naturally a good-looking boy he might readily be mistaken for a gentlemans son Well Queen Victoria said Dick is your missus at home? My names Bridget said the girl Oh indeed! said Dick You looked so much like the queens picter what she gave me last Christmas in exchange for mine that I couldnt help calling you by her name Oh go along wid ye! said Bridget Its makin fun ye are If you dont believe me said Dick gravely all youve got to do is to ask my particlar friend the Duke of Newcastle Bridget! called a shrill voice from the basement The missus is calling me said Bridget hurriedly Ill tell her ye want her All right! said Dick The servant descended into the lower regions and in a short time a stout red-faced woman appeared on the scene Well sir whats your wish? she asked Have you got a room to let? asked Dick Is it for yourself you ask? questioned the woman in some surprise Dick answered in the affirmative I havent got any very good rooms vacant Theres a small room in the third story Id like to see it said Dick I dont know as it would be good enough for you said the woman with a glance at Dicks clothes I aint very particlar about accommodations said our hero I guess Ill look at it Dick followed the landlady up two narrow stair-cases uncarpeted and dirty to the third landing where he was ushered into a room about ten feet square It could not be considered a very desirable apartment It had once been covered with an oilcloth carpet but this was now very ragged and looked worse than none There was a single bed in the corner covered with an indiscriminate heap of bed-clothing rumpled and not over-clean There was a bureau with the veneering scratched and in some parts stripped off and a small glass eight inches by ten cracked across the middle; also two chairs in rather a disjointed condition Judging from Dicks appearance Mrs Mooney thought he would turn from it in disdain But it must be remembered that Dicks past experience had not been of a character to make him fastidious In comparison with a box or an empty wagon even this little room seemed comfortable He decided to hire it if the rent proved reasonable Well whats the tax? asked Dick I ought to have a dollar a week said Mrs Mooney hesitatingly Say seventy-five cents and Ill take it said Dick Every week in advance? Yes Well as times is hard and I cant afford to keep it empty you may have it When will you come? To-night said Dick It aint lookin very neat I dont know as I can fix it up to-night Well Ill sleep here to-night and you can fix it up to-morrow I hope youll excuse the looks Im a lone woman and my help is so shiftless I have to look after everything myself; so I cant keep things as straight as I want to All right! said Dick Can you pay me the first week in advance? asked the landlady cautiously Dick responded by drawing seventy-five cents from his pocket and placing it in her hand Whats your business sir if I may inquire? said Mrs Mooney Oh Im professional! said Dick Indeed! said the landlady who did not feel much enlightened by this answer Hows Tom? asked Dick Do you know my Tom? said Mrs Mooney in surprise Hes gone to sea to Californy He went last week Did he? said Dick Yes I knew him Mrs Mooney looked upon her new lodger with increased favor on finding that he was acquainted with her son who by the way was one of the worst young scamps in Mott Street which is saying considerable Ill bring over my baggage from the Astor House this evening said Dick in a tone of importance From the Astor House! repeated Mrs Mooney in fresh amazement Yes Ive been stoppin there a short time with some friends said Dick Mrs Mooney might be excused for a little amazement at finding that a guest from the Astor House was about to become one of her lodgers such transfers not being common Did you say you was purfessional? she asked Yes maam said Dick politely You aint a a Mrs Mooney paused uncertain what conjecture to hazard Oh no nothing of the sort said Dick promptly How could you think so Mrs Mooney? No offence sir said the landlady more perplexed than ever Certainly not said our hero But you must excuse me now Mrs Mooney as I have business of great importance to attend to Youll come round this evening? Dick answered in the affirmative and turned away I wonder what he is! thought the landlady following him with her eyes as he crossed the street Hes got good clothes on but he dont seem very particular about his room Well; Ive got all my rooms full now Thats one comfort Dick felt more comfortable now that he had taken the decisive step of hiring a lodging and paying a weeks rent in advance For seven nights he was sure of a shelter and a bed to sleep in The thought was a pleasant one to our young vagrant who hitherto had seldom known when he rose in the morning where he should find a resting-place at night I must bring my traps round said Dick to himself I guess Ill go to bed early to-night Itll feel kinder good to sleep in a reglar bed Boxes is rather hard to the back and aint comfortable in case of rain I wonder what Johnny Nolan would say if he knew Id got a room of my own CHAPTER XIII MICKY MAGUIRE About nine oclock Dick sought his new lodgings In his hands he carried his professional wardrobe namely the clothes which he had worn at the commencement of the day and the implements of his business These he stowed away in the bureau drawers and by the light of a flickering candle took off his clothes and went to bed Dick had a good digestion and a reasonably good conscience; consequently he was a good sleeper Perhaps too the soft feather bed conduced to slumber At any rate his eyes were soon closed and he did not awake until half-past six the next morning He lifted himself on his elbow and stared around him in transient bewilderment Blest if I hadnt forgot where I was he said to himself So this is my room is it? Well it seems kind of spectable to have a room and a bed to sleep in Id orter be able to afford seventy-five cents a week Ive throwed away more money than that in one evenin There aint no reason why I shouldnt live spectable I wish I knowed as much as Frank Hes a tip-top feller Nobody ever cared enough for me before to give me good advice It was kicks and cuffs and swearin at me all the time Id like to show him I can do something While Dick was indulging in these reflections he had risen from bed and finding an accession to the furniture of his room in the shape of an ancient wash-stand bearing a cracked bowl and broken pitcher indulged himself in the rather unusual ceremony of a good wash On the whole Dick preferred to be clean but it was not always easy to gratify his desire Lodging in the street as he had been accustomed to do he had had no opportunity to perform his toilet in the customary manner Even now he found himself unable to arrange his dishevelled locks having neither comb nor brush He determined to purchase a comb at least as soon as possible and a brush too if he could get one cheap Meanwhile he combed his hair with his fingers as well as he could though the result was not quite so satisfactory as it might have been A question now came up for consideration For the first time in his life Dick possessed two suits of clothes Should he put on the clothes Frank had given him or resume his old rags? Now twenty-four hours before at the time Dick was introduced to the readers notice no one could have been less fastidious as to his clothing than he Indeed he had rather a contempt for good clothes or at least he thought so But now as he surveyed the ragged and dirty coat and the patched pants Dick felt ashamed of them He was unwilling to appear in the streets with them Yet if he went to work in his new suit he was in danger of spoiling it and he might not have it in his power to purchase a new one Economy dictated a return to the old garments Dick tried them on and surveyed himself in the cracked glass; but the reflection did not please him They dont look spectable he decided; and forthwith taking them off again he put on the new suit of the day before I must try to earn a little more he thought to pay for my room and to buy some new cloes when these is wore out He opened the door of his chamber and went downstairs and into the street carrying his blacking-box with him It was Dicks custom to commence his business before breakfast; generally it must be owned because he began the day penniless and must earn his meal before he ate it To-day it was different He had four dollars left in his pocket-book; but this he had previously determined not to touch In fact he had formed the ambitious design of starting an account at a savings bank in order to have something to fall back upon in case of sickness or any other emergency or at any rate as a reserve fund to expend in clothing or other necessary articles when he required them Hitherto he had been content to live on from day to day without a penny ahead; but the new vision of respectability which now floated before Dicks mind owing to his recent acquaintance with Frank was beginning to exercise a powerful effect upon him In Dicks profession as in others there are lucky days when everything seems to flow prosperously As if to encourage him in his new-born resolution our hero obtained no less than six jobs in the course of an hour and a half This gave him sixty cents quite abundant to purchase his breakfast and a comb besides His exertions made him hungry and entering a small eating-house he ordered a cup of coffee and a beefsteak To this he added a couple of rolls This was quite a luxurious breakfast for Dick and more expensive than he was accustomed to indulge himself with To gratify the curiosity of my young readers I will put down the items with their cost Coffee 5 cts Beefsteak 15 A couple of rolls 5 25 cts It will thus be seen that our hero had expended nearly one-half of his mornings earnings Some days he had been compelled to breakfast on five cents and then he was forced to content himself with a couple of apples or cakes But a good breakfast is a good preparation for a busy day and Dick sallied forth from the restaurant lively and alert ready to do a good stroke of business Dicks change of costume was liable to lead to one result of which he had not thought His brother boot-blacks might think he had grown aristocratic and was putting on airs that in fact he was getting above his business and desirous to outshine his associates Dick had not dreamed of this because in fact in spite of his new-born ambition he entertained no such feeling There was nothing of what boys call big-feeling about him He was a borough democrat using the word not politically but in its proper sense and was disposed to fraternize with all whom he styled good fellows without regard to their position It may seem a little unnecessary to some of my readers to make this explanation; but they must remember that pride and big-feeling are confined to no age or class but may be found in boys as well as men and in boot-blacks as well as those of a higher rank The morning being a busy time with the boot-blacks Dicks changed appearance had not as yet attracted much attention But when business slackened a little our hero was destined to be reminded of it Among the down-town boot-blacks was one hailing from the Five Points a stout red-haired freckled-faced boy of fourteen bearing the name of Micky Maguire This boy by his boldness and recklessness as well as by his personal strength which was considerable had acquired an ascendancy among his fellow professionals and had a gang of subservient followers whom he led on to acts of ruffianism not unfrequently terminating in a month or two at Blackwells Island Micky himself had served two terms there; but the confinement appeared to have had very little effect in amending his conduct except perhaps in making him a little more cautious about an encounter with the copps as the members of the city police are for some unknown reason styled among the Five-Point boys Now Micky was proud of his strength and of the position of leader which it had secured him Moreover he was democratic in his tastes and had a jealous hatred of those who wore good clothes and kept their faces clean He called it putting on airs and resented the implied superiority If he had been fifteen years older and had a trifle more education he would have interested himself in politics and been prominent at ward meetings and a terror to respectable voters on election day As it was he contented himself with being the leader of a gang of young ruffians over whom he wielded a despotic power Now it is only justice to Dick to say that so far as wearing good clothes was concerned he had never hitherto offended the eyes of Micky Maguire Indeed they generally looked as if they patronized the same clothing establishment On this particular morning it chanced that Micky had not been very fortunate in a business way and as a natural consequence his temper never very amiable was somewhat ruffled by the fact He had had a very frugal breakfast not because he felt abstemious but owing to the low state of his finances He was walking along with one of his particular friends a boy nicknamed Limpy Jim so called from a slight peculiarity in his walk when all at once he espied our friend Dick in his new suit My eyes! he exclaimed in astonishment; Jim just look at Ragged Dick Hes come into a fortun and turned gentleman See his new clothes So he has said Jim Whered he get em I wonder? Hooked em praps Lets go and stir him up a little We dont want no gentlemen on our beat So hes puttin on airs is he? Ill give him a lesson So saying the two boys walked up to our hero who had not observed them his back being turned and Micky Maguire gave him a smart slap on the shoulder Dick turned round quickly CHAPTER XIV A BATTLE AND A VICTORY Whats that for? demanded Dick turning round to see who had struck him Youre gettin mighty fine! said Micky Maguire surveying Dicks new clothes with a scornful air There was something in his words and tone which Dick who was disposed to stand up for his dignity did not at all relish Well whats the odds if I am? he retorted Does it hurt you any? See him put on airs Jim said Micky turning to his companion Whered you get them cloes? Never mind where I got em Maybe the Prince of Wales gave em to me Hear him now Jim said Micky Most likely he stole em Stealin aint in _my_ line It might have been unconscious the emphasis which Dick placed on the word my At any rate Micky chose to take offence Do you mean to say _I_ steal? he demanded doubling up his fist and advancing towards Dick in a threatening manner I dont say anything about it answered Dick by no means alarmed at this hostile demonstration I know youve been to the Island twice Praps twas to make a visit along of the Mayor and Aldermen Maybe you was a innocent victim of oppression I aint a goin to say Mickys freckled face grew red with wrath for Dick had only stated the truth Do you mean to insult me? he demanded shaking the fist already doubled up in Dicks face Maybe you want a lickin? I aint particlarly anxious to get one said Dick coolly They dont agree with my constitution which is natrally delicate Id rather have a good dinner than a lickin any time Youre afraid sneered Micky Isnt he Jim? In course he is Praps I am said Dick composedly but it dont trouble me much Do you want to fight? demanded Micky encouraged by Dicks quietness fancying he was afraid to encounter him No I dont said Dick I aint fond of fightin Its a very poor amusement and very bad for the complexion specially for the eyes and nose which is apt to turn red white and blue Micky misunderstood Dick and judged from the tenor of his speech that he would be an easy victim As he knew Dick very seldom was concerned in any street fight not from cowardice as he imagined but because he had too much good sense to do so Being quarrelsome like all bullies and supposing that he was more than a match for our hero being about two inches taller he could no longer resist an inclination to assault him and tried to plant a blow in Dicks face which would have hurt him considerably if he had not drawn back just in time Now though Dick was far from quarrelsome he was ready to defend himself on all occasions and it was too much to expect that he would stand quiet and allow himself to be beaten He dropped his blacking-box on the instant and returned Mickys blow with such good effect that the young bully staggered back and would have fallen if he had not been propped up by his confederate Limpy Jim Go in Micky! shouted the latter who was rather a coward on his own account but liked to see others fight Polish him off thats a good feller Micky was now boiling over with rage and fury and required no urging He was fully determined to make a terrible example of poor Dick He threw himself upon him and strove to bear him to the ground; but Dick avoiding a close hug in which he might possibly have got the worst of it by an adroit movement tripped up his antagonist and stretched him on the side walk Hit him Jim! exclaimed Micky furiously Limpy Jim did not seem inclined to obey orders There was a quiet strength and coolness about Dick which alarmed him He preferred that Micky should incur all the risks of battle and accordingly set himself to raising his fallen comrade Come Micky said Dick quietly youd better give it up I wouldnt have touched you if you hadnt hit me first I dont want to fight Its low business Youre afraid of hurtin your cloes said Micky with a sneer Maybe I am said Dick I hope I havent hurt yours Mickys answer to this was another attack as violent and impetuous as the first But his fury was in the way He struck wildly not measuring his blows and Dick had no difficulty in turning aside so that his antagonists blow fell upon the empty air and his momentum was such that he nearly fell forward headlong Dick might readily have taken advantage of his unsteadiness and knocked him down; but he was not vindictive and chose to act on the defensive except when he could not avoid it Recovering himself Micky saw that Dick was a more formidable antagonist than he had supposed and was meditating another assault better planned which by its impetuosity might bear our hero to the ground But there was an unlooked-for interference Look out for the copp said Jim in a low voice Micky turned round and saw a tall policeman heading towards him and thought it might be prudent to suspend hostilities He accordingly picked up his black-box and hitching up his pants walked off attended by Limpy Jim Whats that chap been doing? asked the policeman of Dick He was amoosin himself by pitchin into me replied Dick What for? He didnt like it cause I patronized a different tailor from him Well it seems to me you _are_ dressed pretty smart for a boot-black said the policeman I wish I wasnt a boot-black said Dick Never mind my lad Its an honest business said the policeman who was a sensible man and a worthy citizen Its an honest business Stick to it till you get something better I mean to said Dick It aint easy to get out of it as the prisoner remarked when he was asked how he liked his residence I hope you dont speak from experience No said Dick; I dont mean to get into prison if I can help it Do you see that gentleman over there? asked the officer pointing to a well-dressed man who was walking on the other side of the street Yes Well he was once a newsboy And what is he now? He keeps a bookstore and is quite prosperous Dick looked at the gentleman with interest wondering if he should look as respectable when he was a grown man It will be seen that Dick was getting ambitious Hitherto he had thought very little of the future but was content to get along as he could dining as well as his means would allow and spending the evenings in the pit of the Old Bowery eating peanuts between the acts if he was prosperous and if unlucky supping on dry bread or an apple and sleeping in an old box or a wagon Now for the first time he began to reflect that he could not black boots all his life In seven years he would be a man and since his meeting with Frank he felt that he would like to be a respectable man He could see and appreciate the difference between Frank and such a boy as Micky Maguire and it was not strange that he preferred the society of the former In the course of the next morning in pursuance of his new resolutions for the future he called at a savings bank and held out four dollars in bills besides another dollar in change There was a high railing and a number of clerks busily writing at desks behind it Dick never having been in a bank before did not know where to go He went by mistake to the desk where money was paid out Wheres your book? asked the clerk I havent got any Have you any money deposited here? No sir I want to leave some here Then go to the next desk Dick followed directions and presented himself before an elderly man with gray hair who looked at him over the rims of his spectacles I want you to keep that for me said Dick awkwardly emptying his money out on the desk How much is there? Five dollars Have you got an account here? No sir Of course you can write? The of course was said on account of Dicks neat dress Have I got to do any writing? asked our hero a little embarrassed We want you to sign your name in this book and the old gentleman shoved round a large folio volume containing the names of depositors Dick surveyed the book with some awe I aint much on writin he said Very well; write as well as you can The pen was put into Dicks hand and after dipping it in the inkstand he succeeded after a hard effort accompanied by many contortions of the face in inscribing upon the book of the bank the name DICK HUNTER Dick! that means Richard I suppose said the bank officer who had some difficulty in making out the signature No; Ragged Dick is what folks call me You dont look very ragged No Ive left my rags to home They might get wore out if I used em too common Well my lad Ill make out a book in the name of Dick Hunter since you seem to prefer Dick to Richard I hope you will save up your money and deposit more with us Our hero took his bank-book and gazed on the entry Five Dollars with a new sense of importance He had been accustomed to joke about Erie shares but now for the first time he felt himself a capitalist; on a small scale to be sure but still it was no small thing for Dick to have five dollars which he could call his own He firmly determined that he would lay by every cent he could spare from his earnings towards the fund he hoped to accumulate But Dick was too sensible not to know that there was something more than money needed to win a respectable position in the world He felt that he was very ignorant Of reading and writing he only knew the rudiments and that with a slight acquaintance with arithmetic was all he did know of books Dick knew he must study hard and he dreaded it He looked upon learning as attended with greater difficulties than it really possesses But Dick had good pluck He meant to learn nevertheless and resolved to buy a book with his first spare earnings When Dick went home at night he locked up his bank-book in one of the drawers of the bureau It was wonderful how much more independent he felt whenever he reflected upon the contents of that drawer and with what an important air of joint ownership he regarded the bank building in which his small savings were deposited CHAPTER XV DICK SECURES A TUTOR The next morning Dick was unusually successful having plenty to do and receiving for one job twenty-five cents the gentleman refusing to take change Then flashed upon Dicks mind the thought that he had not yet returned the change due to the gentleman whose boots he had blacked on the morning of his introduction to the reader Whatll he think of me? said Dick to himself I hope he wont think Im mean enough to keep the money Now Dick was scrupulously honest and though the temptation to be otherwise had often been strong he had always resisted it He was not willing on any account to keep money which did not belong to him and he immediately started for 125 Fulton Street (the address which had been given him) where he found Mr Greysons name on the door of an office on the first floor The door being open Dick walked in Is Mr Greyson in? he asked of a clerk who sat on a high stool before a desk Not just now Hell be in soon Will you wait? Yes said Dick Very well; take a seat then Dick sat down and took up the morning Tribune but presently came to a word of four syllables which he pronounced to himself a sticker and laid it down But he had not long to wait for five minutes later Mr Greyson entered Did you wish to speak to me my lad? said he to Dick whom in his new clothes he did not recognize Yes sir said Dick I owe you some money Indeed! said Mr Greyson pleasantly; thats an agreeable surprise I didnt know but you had come for some So you are a debtor of mine and not a creditor? I blieve thats right said Dick drawing fifteen cents from his pocket and placing in Mr Greysons hand Fifteen cents! repeated he in some surprise How do you happen to be indebted to me in that amount? You gave me a quarter for a-shinin your boots yesterday mornin and couldnt wait for the change I meant to have brought it before but I forgot all about it till this mornin It had quite slipped my mind also But you dont look like the boy I employed If I remember rightly he wasnt as well dressed as you No said Dick I was dressed for a party then but the cloes was too well ventilated to be comfortable in cold weather Youre an honest boy said Mr Greyson Who taught you to be honest? Nobody said Dick But its mean to cheat and steal Ive always knowed that Then youve got ahead of some of our business men Do you read the Bible? No said Dick Ive heard its a good book but I dont know much about it You ought to go to some Sunday School Would you be willing? Yes said Dick promptly I want to grow up spectable But I dont know where to go Then Ill tell you The church I attend is at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Twenty-first Street Ive seen it said Dick I have a class in the Sunday School there If youll come next Sunday Ill take you into my class and do what I can to help you Thank you said Dick but praps youll get tired of teaching me Im awful ignorant No my lad said Mr Greyson kindly You evidently have some good principles to start with as you have shown by your scorn of dishonesty I shall hope good things of you in the future Well Dick said our hero apostrophizing himself as he left the office; youre gettin up in the world Youve got money invested and are goin to attend church by particlar invitation on Fifth Avenue I shouldnt wonder much if you should find cards when you get home from the Mayor requestin the honor of your company to dinner along with other distinguished guests Dick felt in very good spirits He seemed to be emerging from the world in which he had hitherto lived into a new atmosphere of respectability and the change seemed very pleasant to him At six oclock Dick went into a restaurant on Chatham Street and got a comfortable supper He had been so successful during the day that after paying for this he still had ninety cents left While he was despatching his supper another boy came in smaller and slighter than Dick and sat down beside him Dick recognized him as a boy who three months before had entered the ranks of the boot-blacks but who from a natural timidity had not been able to earn much He was ill-fitted for the coarse companionship of the street boys and shrank from the rude jokes of his present associates Dick had never troubled him; for our hero had a certain chivalrous feeling which would not allow him to bully or disturb a younger and weaker boy than himself How are you Fosdick? said Dick as the other seated himself Pretty well said Fosdick I suppose youre all right Oh yes Im right side up with care Ive been havin a bully supper What are you goin to have? Some bread and butter Why dont you get a cup o coffee? Why said Fosdick reluctantly I havent got money enough to-night Never mind said Dick; Im in luck to-day Ill stand treat Thats kind in you said Fosdick gratefully Oh never mind that said Dick Accordingly he ordered a cup of coffee and a plate of beefsteak and was gratified to see that his young companion partook of both with evident relish When the repast was over the boys went out into the street together Dick pausing at the desk to settle for both suppers Where are you going to sleep to-night Fosdick? asked Dick as they stood on the sidewalk I dont know said Fosdick a little sadly In some doorway I expect But Im afraid the police will find me out and make me move on Ill tell you what said Dick you must go home with me I guess my bed will hold two Have you got a room? asked the other in surprise Yes said Dick rather proudly and with a little excusable exultation Ive got a room over in Mott Street; there I can receive my friends Thatll be better than sleepin in a door-way wont it? Yes indeed it will said Fosdick How lucky I was to come across you! It comes hard to me living as I do When my father was alive I had every comfort Thats moren I ever had said Dick But Im goin to try to live comfortable now Is your father dead? Yes said Fosdick sadly He was a printer; but he was drowned one dark night from a Fulton ferry-boat and as I had no relations in the city and no money I was obliged to go to work as quick as I could But I dont get on very well Didnt you have no brothers nor sisters? asked Dick No said Fosdick; father and I used to live alone He was always so much company to me that I feel very lonesome without him Theres a man out West somewhere that owes him two thousand dollars He used to live in the city and father lent him all his money to help him go into business; but he failed or pretended to and went off If father hadnt lost that money he would have left me well off; but no money would have made up his loss to me Whats the mans name that went off with your fathers money? His name is Hiram Bates Praps youll get the money again sometime There isnt much chance of it said Fosdick Id sell out my chances of that for five dollars Maybe Ill buy you out sometime said Dick Now come round and see what sort of a room Ive got I used to go to the theatre evenings when I had money; but now Id rather go to bed early and have a good sleep I dont care much about theatres said Fosdick Father didnt use to let me go very often He said it wasnt good for boys I like to go to the Old Bowery sometimes They have tip-top plays there Can you read and write well? he asked as a sudden thought came to him Yes said Fosdick Father always kept me at school when he was alive and I stood pretty well in my classes I was expecting to enter at the Free Academy* next year * Now the college of the city of New York Then Ill tell you what said Dick; Ill make a bargain with you I cant read much moren a pig; and my writin looks like hens tracks I dont want to grow up knowin no moren a four-year-old boy If youll teach me readin and writin evenins you shall sleep in my room every night Thatll be bettern door-steps or old boxes where Ive slept many a time Are you in earnest? said Fosdick his face lighting up hopefully In course I am said Dick Its fashionable for young gentlemen to have private tootors to introduct em into the flower-beds of literatoor and science and why shouldnt I foller the fashion? You shall be my perfessor; only you must promise not to be very hard if my writin looks like a rail-fence on a bender Ill try not to be too severe said Fosdick laughing I shall be thankful for such a chance to get a place to sleep Have you got anything to read out of? No said Dick My extensive and well-selected library was lost overboard in a storm when I was sailin from the Sandwich Islands to the desert of Sahara But Ill buy a paper Thatll do me a long time Accordingly Dick stopped at a paper-stand and bought a copy of a weekly paper filled with the usual variety of reading matter stories sketches poems etc They soon arrived at Dicks lodging-house Our hero procuring a lamp from the landlady led the way into his apartment which he entered with the proud air of a proprietor Well how do you like it Fosdick? he asked complacently The time was when Fosdick would have thought it untidy and not particularly attractive But he had served a severe apprenticeship in the streets and it was pleasant to feel himself under shelter and he was not disposed to be critical It looks very comfortable Dick he said The bed aint very large said Dick; but I guess we can get along Oh yes said Fosdick cheerfully I dont take up much room Then thats all right Theres two chairs you see one for you and one for me In case the mayor comes in to spend the evenin socially he can sit on the bed The boys seated themselves and five minutes later under the guidance of his young tutor Dick had commenced his studies CHAPTER XVI THE FIRST LESSON Fortunately for Dick his young tutor was well qualified to instruct him Henry Fosdick though only twelve years old knew as much as many boys of fourteen He had always been studious and ambitious to excel His father being a printer employed in an office where books were printed often brought home new books in sheets which Henry was always glad to read Mr Fosdick had been besides a subscriber to the Mechanics Apprentices Library which contains many thousands of well-selected and instructive books Thus Henry had acquired an amount of general information unusual in a boy of his age Perhaps he had devoted too much time to study for he was not naturally robust All this however fitted him admirably for the office to which Dick had appointed him that of his private instructor The two boys drew up their chairs to the rickety table and spread out the paper before them The exercises generally Commence with ringin the bell said Dick; but as I aint got none well have to do without And the teacher is generally provided with a rod said Fosdick Isnt there a poker handy that I can use in case my scholar doesnt behave well? Taint lawful to use fire-arms said Dick Now Dick said Fosdick before we begin I must find out how much you already know Can you read any? Not enough to hurt me said Dick All I know about readin you could put in a nutshell and thered be room left for a small family I suppose you know your letters? Yes said Dick I know em all but not intimately I guess I can call em all by name Where did you learn them? Did you ever go to school? Yes; I went two days Why did you stop? It didnt agree with my constitution You dont look very delicate said Fosdick No said Dick I aint troubled much that way; but I found lickins didnt agree with me Did you get punished? Awful said Dick What for? For indulgin in a little harmless amoosement said Dick You see the boy that was sittin next to me fell asleep which I considered improper in school-time; so I thought Id help the teacher a little by wakin him up So I took a pin and stuck into him; but I guess it went a little too far for he screeched awful The teacher found out what it was that made him holler and whipped me with a ruler till I was black and blue I thought twas about time to take a vacation; so thats the last time I went to school You didnt learn to read in that time of course? No said Dick; but I was a newsboy a little while; so I learned a little just sos to find out what the news was Sometimes I didnt read straight and called the wrong news One mornin I asked another boy what the paper said and he told me the King of Africa was dead I thought it was all right till folks began to laugh Well Dick if youll only study well you wont be liable to make such mistakes I hope so said Dick My friend Horace Greeley told me the other day that hed get me to take his place now and then when he was off makin speeches if my edication hadnt been neglected I must find a good piece for you to begin on said Fosdick looking over the paper Find an easy one said Dick with words of one story Fosdick at length found a piece which he thought would answer He discovered on trial that Dick had not exaggerated his deficiencies Words of two syllables he seldom pronounced right and was much surprised when he was told how through was sounded Seems to me its throwin away letters to use all them he said How would you spell it? asked his young teacher T-h-r-u said Dick Well said Fosdick theres a good many other words that are spelt with more letters than they need to have But its the fashion and we must follow it But if Dick was ignorant he was quick and had an excellent capacity Moreover he had perseverance and was not easily discouraged He had made up his mind he must know more and was not disposed to complain of the difficulty of his task Fosdick had occasion to laugh more than once at his ludicrous mistakes; but Dick laughed too and on the whole both were quite interested in the lesson At the end of an hour and a half the boys stopped for the evening Youre learning fast Dick said Fosdick At this rate you will soon learn to read well Will I? asked Dick with an expression of satisfaction Im glad of that I dont want to be ignorant I didnt use to care but I do now I want to grow up spectable So do I Dick We will both help each other and I am sure we can accomplish something But I am beginning to feel sleepy So am I said Dick Them hard words make my head ache I wonder who made em all? Thats more than I can tell I suppose youve seen a dictionary Thats another of em No I cant say I have though I may have seen him in the street without knowin him A dictionary is a book containing all the words in the language How many are there? I dont rightly know; but I think there are about fifty thousand Its a pretty large family said Dick Have I got to learn em all? That will not be necessary There are a large number which you would never find occasion to use Im glad of that said Dick; for I dont expect to live to be moren a hundred and by that time I wouldnt be moren half through By this time the flickering lamp gave a decided hint to the boys that unless they made haste they would have to undress in the dark They accordingly drew off their clothes and Dick jumped into bed But Fosdick before doing so knelt down by the side of the bed and said a short prayer Whats that for? asked Dick curiously I was saying my prayers said Fosdick as he rose from his knees Dont you ever do it? No said Dick Nobody ever taught me Then Ill teach you Shall I? I dont know said Dick dubiously Whats the good? Fosdick explained as well as he could and perhaps his simple explanation was better adapted to Dicks comprehension than one from an older person would have been Dick felt more free to ask questions and the example of his new friend for whom he was beginning to feel a warm attachment had considerable effect upon him When therefore Fosdick asked again if he should teach him a prayer Dick consented and his young bedfellow did so Dick was not naturally irreligious If he had lived without a knowledge of God and of religious things it was scarcely to be wondered at in a lad who from an early age had been thrown upon his own exertions for the means of living with no one to care for him or give him good advice But he was so far good that he could appreciate goodness in others and this it was that had drawn him to Frank in the first place and now to Henry Fosdick He did not therefore attempt to ridicule his companion as some boys better brought up might have done but was willing to follow his example in what something told him was right Our young hero had taken an important step toward securing that genuine respectability which he was ambitious to attain Weary with the days work and Dick perhaps still more fatigued by the unusual mental effort he had made the boys soon sank into a deep and peaceful slumber from which they did not awaken till six oclock the next morning Before going out Dick sought Mrs Mooney and spoke to her on the subject of taking Fosdick as a room-mate He found that she had no objection provided he would allow her twenty-five cents a week extra in consideration of the extra trouble which his companion might be expected to make To this Dick assented and the arrangement was definitely concluded This over the two boys went out and took stations near each other Dick had more of a business turn than Henry and less shrinking from publicity so that his earnings were greater But he had undertaken to pay the entire expenses of the room and needed to earn more Sometimes when two customers presented themselves at the same time he was able to direct one to his friend So at the end of the week both boys found themselves with surplus earnings Dick had the satisfaction of adding two dollars and a half to his deposits in the Savings Bank and Fosdick commenced an account by depositing seventy-five cents On Sunday morning Dick bethought himself of his promise to Mr Greyson to come to the church on Fifth Avenue To tell the truth Dick recalled it with some regret He had never been inside a church since he could remember and he was not much attracted by the invitation he had received But Henry finding him wavering urged him to go and offered to go with him Dick gladly accepted the offer feeling that he required someone to lend him countenance under such unusual circumstances Dick dressed himself with scrupulous care giving his shoes a shine so brilliant that it did him great credit in a professional point of view and endeavored to clean his hands thoroughly; but in spite of all he could do they were not so white as if his business had been of a different character Having fully completed his preparations he descended into the street and with Henry by his side crossed over to Broadway The boys pursued their way up Broadway which on Sunday presents a striking contrast in its quietness to the noise and confusion of ordinary week-days as far as Union Square then turned down Fourteenth Street which brought them to Fifth Avenue Suppose we dine at Delmonicos said Fosdick looking towards that famous restaurant Id have to sell some of my Erie shares said Dick A short walk now brought them to the church of which mention has already been made They stood outside a little abashed watching the fashionably attired people who were entering and were feeling a little undecided as to whether they had better enter also when Dick felt a light touch upon his shoulder Turning round he met the smiling glance of Mr Greyson So my young friend you have kept your promise he said And whom have you brought with you? A friend of mine said Dick His name is Henry Fosdick I am glad you have brought him Now follow me and I will give you seats CHAPTER XVII DICKS FIRST APPEARANCE IN SOCIETY It was the hour for morning service The boys followed Mr Greyson into the handsome church and were assigned seats in his own pew There were two persons already seated in it a good-looking lady of middle age and a pretty little girl of nine They were Mrs Greyson and her only daughter Ida They looked pleasantly at the boys as they entered smiling a welcome to them The morning service commenced It must be acknowledged that Dick felt rather awkward It was an unusual place for him and it need not be wondered at that he felt like a cat in a strange garret He would not have known when to rise if he had not taken notice of what the rest of the audience did and followed their example He was sitting next to Ida and as it was the first time he had ever been near so well-dressed a young lady he naturally felt bashful When the hymns were announced Ida found the place and offered a hymn-book to our hero Dick took it awkwardly but his studies had not yet been pursued far enough for him to read the words readily However he resolved to keep up appearances and kept his eyes fixed steadily on the hymn-book At length the service was over The people began to file slowly out of church and among them of course Mr Greysons family and the two boys It seemed very strange to Dick to find himself in such different companionship from what he had been accustomed and he could not help thinking Wonder what Johnny Nolan ould say if he could see me now! But Johnnys business engagements did not often summon him to Fifth Avenue and Dick was not likely to be seen by any of his friends in the lower part of the city We have our Sunday school in the afternoon said Mr Greyson I suppose you live at some distance from here? In Mott Street sir answered Dick That is too far to go and return Suppose you and your friend come and dine with us and then we can come here together in the afternoon Dick was as much astonished at this invitation as if he had really been invited by the Mayor to dine with him and the Board of Aldermen Mr Greyson was evidently a rich man and yet he had actually invited two boot-blacks to dine with him I guess wed better go home sir said Dick hesitating I dont think you can have any very pressing engagements to interfere with your accepting my invitation said Mr Greyson good-humoredly for he understood the reason of Dicks hesitation So I take it for granted that you both accept Before Dick fairly knew what he intended to do he was walking down Fifth Avenue with his new friends Now our young hero was not naturally bashful; but he certainly felt so now especially as Miss Ida Greyson chose to walk by his side leaving Henry Fosdick to walk with her father and mother What is your name? asked Ida pleasantly Our hero was about to answer Ragged Dick when it occurred to him that in the present company he had better forget his old nickname Dick Hunter he answered Dick! repeated Ida That means Richard doesnt it? Everybody calls me Dick I have a cousin Dick said the young lady sociably His name is Dick Wilson I suppose you dont know him? No said Dick I like the name of Dick said the young lady with charming frankness Without being able to tell why Dick felt rather glad she did He plucked up courage to ask her name My name is Ida answered the young lady Do you like it? Yes said Dick Its a bully name Dick turned red as soon as he had said it for he felt that he had not used the right expression The little girl broke into a silvery laugh What a funny boy you are! she said I didnt mean it said Dick stammering I meant its a tip-top name Here Ida laughed again and Dick wished himself back in Mott Street How old are you? inquired Ida continuing her examination Im fourteen goin on fifteen said Dick Youre a big boy of your age said Ida My cousin Dick is a year older than you but he isnt as large Dick looked pleased Boys generally like to be told that they are large of their age How old be you? asked Dick beginning to feel more at his ease Im nine years old said Ida I go to Miss Jarviss school Ive just begun to learn French Do you know French? Not enough to hurt me said Dick Ida laughed again and told him that he was a droll boy Do you like it? asked Dick I like it pretty well except the verbs I cant remember them well Do you go to school? Im studying with a private tutor said Dick Are you? So is my cousin Dick Hes going to college this year Are you going to college? Not this year Because if you did you know youd be in the same class with my cousin It would be funny to have two Dicks in one class They turned down Twenty-fourth Street passing the Fifth Avenue Hotel on the left and stopped before an elegant house with a brown stone front The bell was rung and the door being opened the boys somewhat abashed followed Mr Greyson into a handsome hall They were told where to hang their hats and a moment afterwards were ushered into a comfortable dining-room where a table was spread for dinner Dick took his seat on the edge of a sofa and was tempted to rub his eyes to make sure that he was really awake He could hardly believe that he was a guest in so fine a mansion Ida helped to put the boys at their ease Do you like pictures? she asked Very much answered Henry The little girl brought a book of handsome engravings and seating herself beside Dick to whom she seemed to have taken a decided fancy commenced showing them to him There are the Pyramids of Egypt she said pointing to one engraving What are they for? asked Dick puzzled I dont see any winders No said Ida I dont believe anybody lives there Do they papa? No my dear They were used for the burial of the dead The largest of them is said to be the loftiest building in the world with one exception The spire of the Cathedral of Strasburg is twenty-four feet higher if I remember rightly Is Egypt near here? asked Dick Oh no its ever so many miles off; about four or five hundred Didnt you know? No said Dick I never heard You dont appear to be very accurate in your information Ida said her mother Four or five thousand miles would be considerably nearer the truth After a little more conversation they sat down to dinner Dick seated himself in an embarrassed way He was very much afraid of doing or saying something which would be considered an impropriety and had the uncomfortable feeling that everybody was looking at him and watching his behavior Where do you live Dick? asked Ida familiarly In Mott Street Where is that? More than a mile off Is it a nice street? Not very said Dick Only poor folks live there Are you poor? Little girls should be seen and not heard said her mother gently If you are said Ida Ill give you the five-dollar gold-piece aunt gave me for a birthday present Dick cannot be called poor my child said Mrs Greyson since he earns his living by his own exertions Do you earn your living? asked Ida who was a very inquisitive young lady and not easily silenced What do you do? Dick blushed violently At such a table and in presence of the servant who was standing at that moment behind his chair he did not like to say that he was a shoe-black although he well knew that there was nothing dishonorable in the occupation Mr Greyson perceived his feelings and to spare them said You are too inquisitive Ida Sometime Dick may tell you but you know we dont talk of business on Sundays Dick in his embarrassment had swallowed a large spoonful of hot soup which made him turn red in the face For the second time in spite of the prospect of the best dinner he had ever eaten he wished himself back in Mott Street Henry Fosdick was more easy and unembarrassed than Dick not having led such a vagabond and neglected life But it was to Dick that Ida chiefly directed her conversation having apparently taken a fancy to his frank and handsome face I believe I have already said that Dick was a very good-looking boy especially now since he kept his face clean He had a frank honest expression which generally won its way to the favor of those with whom he came in contact Dick got along pretty well at the table by dint of noticing how the rest acted but there was one thing he could not manage eating with his fork which by the way he thought a very singular arrangement At length they arose from the table somewhat to Dicks relief Again Ida devoted herself to the boys and exhibited a profusely illustrated Bible for their entertainment Dick was interested in looking at the pictures though he knew very little of their subjects Henry Fosdick was much better informed as might have been expected When the boys were about to leave the house with Mr Greyson for the Sunday school Ida placed her hand in Dicks and said persuasively Youll come again Dick wont you? Thank you said Dick Id like to and he could not help thinking Ida the nicest girl he had ever seen Yes said Mrs Greyson hospitably we shall be glad to see you both here again Thank you very much said Henry Fosdick gratefully We shall like very much to come I will not dwell upon the hour spent in Sunday school nor upon the remarks of Mr Greyson to his class He found Dicks ignorance of religious subjects so great that he was obliged to begin at the beginning with him Dick was interested in hearing the children sing and readily promised to come again the next Sunday When the service was over Dick and Henry walked homewards Dick could not help letting his thoughts rest on the sweet little girl who had given him so cordial a welcome and hoping that he might meet her again Mr Greyson is a nice man isnt he Dick? asked Henry as they were turning into Mott Street and were already in sight of their lodging-house Aint he though? said Dick He treated us just as if we were young gentlemen Ida seemed to take a great fancy to you Shes a tip-top girl said Dick but she asked so many questions that I didnt know what to say He had scarcely finished speaking when a stone whizzed by his head and turning quickly he saw Micky Maguire running round the corner of the street which they had just passed CHAPTER XVIII MICKY MAGUIRES SECOND DEFEAT Dick was no coward Nor was he in the habit of submitting passively to an insult When therefore he recognized Micky as his assailant he instantly turned and gave chase Micky anticipated pursuit and ran at his utmost speed It is doubtful if Dick would have overtaken him but Micky had the ill luck to trip just as he had entered a narrow alley and falling with some violence received a sharp blow from the hard stones which made him scream with pain Ow! he whined Dont you hit a feller when hes down What made you fire that stone at me? demanded our hero looking down at the fallen bully Just for fun said Micky It would have been a very agreeable sprise if it had hit me said Dick Sposin I fire a rock at you jest for fun Dont! exclaimed Micky in alarm It seems you dont like agreeable sprises said Dick any moren the man did what got hooked by a cow one mornin before breakfast It didnt improve his appetite much Ive most broke my arm said Micky ruefully rubbing the affected limb If its broke you cant fire no more stones which is a very cheerin reflection said Dick Ef you havent money enough to buy a wooden one Ill lend you a quarter Theres one good thing about wooden ones they aint liable to get cold in winter which is another cheerin reflection I dont want none of yer cheerin reflections said Micky sullenly Yer company aint wanted here Thank you for your polite invitation to leave said Dick bowing ceremoniously Im willin to go but ef you throw any more stones at me Micky Maguire Ill hurt you worse than the stones did The only answer made to this warning was a scowl from his fallen opponent It was quite evident that Dick had the best of it and he thought it prudent to say nothing As Ive got a friend waitin outside I shall have to tear myself away said Dick Youd better not throw any more stones Micky Maguire for it dont seem to agree with your constitution Micky muttered something which Dick did not stay to hear He backed out of the alley keeping a watchful eye on his fallen foe and rejoined Henry Fosdick who was awaiting his return Who was it Dick? he asked A particlar friend of mine Micky Maguire said Dick He playfully fired a rock at my head as a mark of his fection He loves me like a brother Micky does Rather a dangerous kind of a friend I should think said Fosdick He might have killed you Ive warned him not to be so fectionate another time said Dick I know him said Henry Fosdick Hes at the head of a gang of boys living at the Five-Points He threatened to whip me once because a gentleman employed me to black his boots instead of him Hes been at the Island two or three times for stealing said Dick I guess he wont touch me again Hed rather get hold of small boys If he ever does anything to you Fosdick just let me know and Ill give him a thrashing Dick was right Micky Maguire was a bully and like most bullies did not fancy tackling boys whose strength was equal or superior to his own Although he hated Dick more than ever because he thought our hero was putting on airs he had too lively a remembrance of his strength and courage to venture upon another open attack He contented himself therefore whenever he met Dick with scowling at him Dick took this very philosophically remarking that if it was soothin to Mickys feelings he might go ahead as it didnt hurt him much It will not be necessary to chronicle the events of the next few weeks A new life had commenced for Dick He no longer haunted the gallery of the Old Bowery; and even Tony Pastors hospitable doors had lost their old attractions He spent two hours every evening in study His progress was astonishingly rapid He was gifted with a natural quickness; and he was stimulated by the desire to acquire a fair education as a means of growin up spectable as he termed it Much was due also to the patience and perseverance of Henry Fosdick who made a capital teacher Youre improving wonderfully Dick said his friend one evening when Dick had read an entire paragraph without a mistake Am I? said Dick with satisfaction Yes If youll buy a writing-book to-morrow we can begin writing to-morrow evening What else do you know Henry? asked Dick Arithmetic and geography and grammar What a lot you know! said Dick admiringly I dont _know_ any of them said Fosdick Ive only studied them I wish I knew a great deal more Ill be satisfied when I know as much as you said Dick It seems a great deal to you now Dick but in a few months youll think differently The more you know the more youll want to know Then there aint any end to learnin? said Dick No Well said Dick I guess Ill be as much as sixty before I know everything Yes; as old as that probably said Fosdick laughing Anyway you know too much to be blackin boots Leave that to ignorant chaps like me You wont be ignorant long Dick Youd ought to get into some office or countin-room I wish I could said Fosdick earnestly I dont succeed very well at blacking boots You make a great deal more than I do Thats cause I aint troubled with bashfulness said Dick Bashfulness aint as natural to me as it is to you Im always on hand as the cat said to the milk Youd better give up shines Fosdick and give your tention to mercantile pursuits Ive thought of trying to get a place said Fosdick; but no one would take me with these clothes; and he directed his glance to his well-worn suit which he kept as neat as he could but which in spite of all his care began to show decided marks of use There was also here and there a stain of blacking upon it which though an advertisement of his profession scarcely added to its good appearance I almost wanted to stay at home from Sunday school last Sunday he continued because I thought everybody would notice how dirty and worn my clothes had got to be If my clothes wasnt two sizes too big for you said Dick generously Id change Youd look as if youd got into your great-uncles suit by mistake Youre very kind Dick to think of changing said Fosdick for your suit is much better than mine; but I dont think that mine would suit you very well The pants would show a little more of your ankles than is the fashion and you couldnt eat a very hearty dinner without bursting the buttons off the vest That wouldnt be very convenient said Dick I aint fond of lacin to show my elegant figger But I say he added with a sudden thought how much money have we got in the savings bank? Fosdick took a key from his pocket and went to the drawer in which the bank-books were kept and opening it brought them out for inspection It was found that Dick had the sum of eighteen dollars and ninety cents placed to his credit while Fosdick had six dollars and forty-five cents To explain the large difference it must be remembered that Dick had deposited five dollars before Henry deposited anything being the amount he had received as a gift from Mr Whitney How much does that make the lot of it? asked Dick I aint much on figgers yet you know It makes twenty-five dollars and thirty-five cents Dick said his companion who did not understand the thought which suggested the question Take it and buy some clothes Henry said Dick shortly What your money too? In course No Dick you are too generous I couldnt think of it Almost three-quarters of the money is yours You must spend it on yourself I dont need it said Dick You may not need it now but you will some time I shall have some more then That may be; but it wouldnt be fair for me to use your money Dick I thank you all the same for your kindness Well Ill lend it to you then persisted Dick and you can pay me when you get to be a rich merchant But it isnt likely I ever shall be one How dyou know? I went to a fortun teller once and she told me I was born under a lucky star with a hard name and I should have a rich man for my particular friend who would make my fortun I guess you are going to be the rich man Fosdick laughed and steadily refused for some time to avail himself of Dicks generous proposal; but at length perceiving that our hero seemed much disappointed and would be really glad if his offer were accepted he agreed to use as much as might be needful This at once brought back Dicks good-humor and he entered with great enthusiasm into his friends plans The next day they withdrew the money from the bank and when business got a little slack in the afternoon set out in search of a clothing store Dick knew enough of the city to be able to find a place where a good bargain could be obtained He was determined that Fosdick should have a good serviceable suit even if it took all the money they had The result of their search was that for twenty-three dollars Fosdick obtained a very neat outfit including a couple of shirts a hat and a pair of shoes besides a dark mixed suit which appeared stout and of good quality Shall I send the bundle home? asked the salesman impressed by the off-hand manner in which Dick drew out the money in payment for the clothes Thank you said Dick youre very kind but Ill take it home myself and you can allow me something for my trouble All right said the clerk laughing; Ill allow it on your next purchase Proceeding to their apartment in Mott Street Fosdick at once tried on his new suit and it was found to be an excellent fit Dick surveyed his new friend with much satisfaction You look like a young gentleman of fortun he said and do credit to your governor I suppose that means you Dick said Fosdick laughing In course it does You should say _of_ course said Fosdick who in virtue of his position as Dicks tutor ventured to correct his language from time to time How dare you correct your govnor? said Dick with comic indignation Ill cut you off with a shillin you young dog as the Markis says to his nephew in the play at the Old Bowery CHAPTER XIX FOSDICK CHANGES HIS BUSINESS Fosdick did not venture to wear his new clothes while engaged in his business This he felt would have been wasteful extravagance About ten oclock in the morning when business slackened he went home and dressing himself went to a hotel where he could see copies of the Morning Herald and Sun and noting down the places where a boy was wanted went on a round of applications But he found it no easy thing to obtain a place Swarms of boys seemed to be out of employment and it was not unusual to find from fifty to a hundred applicants for a single place There was another difficulty It was generally desired that the boy wanted should reside with his parents When Fosdick on being questioned revealed the fact of his having no parents and being a boy of the street this was generally sufficient of itself to insure a refusal Merchants were afraid to trust one who had led such a vagabond life Dick who was always ready for an emergency suggested borrowing a white wig and passing himself off for Fosdicks father or grandfather But Henry thought this might be rather a difficult character for our hero to sustain After fifty applications and as many failures Fosdick began to get discouraged There seemed to be no way out of his present business for which he felt unfitted I dont know but I shall have to black boots all my life he said one day despondently to Dick Keep a stiff upper lip said Dick By the time you get to be a gray-headed veteran you may get a chance to run errands for some big firm on the Bowery which is a very cheerin reflection So Dick by his drollery and perpetual good spirits kept up Fosdicks courage As for me said Dick I expect by that time to lay up a colossal fortun out of shines and live in princely style on the Avenoo But one morning Fosdick straying into Frenchs Hotel discovered the following advertisement in the columns of The Herald WANTED A smart capable boy to run errands and make himself generally useful in a hat and cap store Salary three dollars a week at first Inquire at No Broadway after ten oclock AM He determined to make application and as the City Hall clock just then struck the hour indicated lost no time in proceeding to the store which was only a few blocks distant from the Astor House It was easy to find the store as from a dozen to twenty boys were already assembled in front of it They surveyed each other askance feeling that they were rivals and mentally calculating each others chances There isnt much chance for me said Fosdick to Dick who had accompanied him Look at all these boys Most of them have good homes I suppose and good recommendations while I have nobody to refer to Go ahead said Dick Your chance is as good as anybodys While this was passing between Dick and his companion one of the boys a rather supercilious-looking young gentleman genteelly dressed and evidently having a very high opinion of his dress and himself turned suddenly to Dick and remarked Ive seen you before Oh have you? said Dick whirling round; then praps youd like to see me behind At this unexpected answer all the boys burst into a laugh with the exception of the questioner who evidently considered that Dick had been disrespectful Ive seen you somewhere he said in a surly tone correcting himself Most likely you have said Dick Thats where I generally keep myself There was another laugh at the expense of Roswell Crawford for that was the name of the young aristocrat But he had his revenge ready No boy relishes being an object of ridicule and it was with a feeling of satisfaction that he retorted I know you for all your impudence Youre nothing but a boot-black This information took the boys who were standing around by surprise for Dick was well-dressed and had none of the implements of his profession with him Spose I be said Dick Have you got any objection? Not at all said Roswell curling his lip; only youd better stick to blacking boots and not try to get into a store Thank you for your kind advice said Dick Is it gratooitous or do you expect to be paid for it? Youre an impudent fellow Thats a very cheerin reflection said Dick good-naturedly Do you expect to get this place when theres gentlemens sons applying for it? A boot-black in a store! That would be a good joke Boys as well as men are selfish and looking upon Dick as a possible rival the boys who listened seemed disposed to take the same view of the situation Thats what I say said one of them taking sides with Roswell Dont trouble yourselves said Dick I aint agoin to cut you out I cant afford to give up a independent and loocrative purfession for a salary of three dollars a week Hear him talk! said Roswell Crawford with an unpleasant sneer If you are not trying to get the place what are you here for? I came with a friend of mine said Dick indicating Fosdick whos goin in for the situation Is he a boot-black too? demanded Roswell superciliously He! retorted Dick loftily Didnt you know his father was a member of Congress and intimately acquainted with all the biggest men in the State? The boys surveyed Fosdick as if they did not quite know whether to credit this statement which for the credit of Dicks veracity it will be observed he did not assert but only propounded in the form of a question There was no time for comment however as just then the proprietor of the store came to the door and casting his eyes over the waiting group singled out Roswell Crawford and asked him to enter Well my lad how old are you? Fourteen years old said Roswell consequentially Are your parents living? Only my mother My father is dead He was a gentleman he added complacently Oh was he? said the shop-keeper Do you live in the city? Yes sir In Clinton Place Have you ever been in a situation before? Yes sir said Roswell a little reluctantly Where was it? In an office on Dey Street How long were you there? A week It seems to me that was a short time Why did you not stay longer? Because said Roswell loftily the man wanted me to get to the office at eight oclock and make the fire Im a gentlemans son and am not used to such dirty work Indeed! said the shop-keeper Well young gentleman you may step aside a few minutes I will speak with some of the other boys before making my selection Several other boys were called in and questioned Roswell stood by and listened with an air of complacency He could not help thinking his chances the best The man can see Im a gentleman and will do credit to his store he thought At length it came to Fosdicks turn He entered with no very sanguine anticipations of success Unlike Roswell he set a very low estimate upon his qualifications when compared with those of other applicants But his modest bearing and quiet gentlemanly manner entirely free from pretension prepossessed the shop-keeper who was a sensible man in his favor Do you reside in the city? he asked Yes sir said Henry What is your age? Twelve Have you ever been in any situation? No sir I should like to see a specimen of your handwriting Here take the pen and write your name Henry Fosdick had a very handsome handwriting for a boy of his age while Roswell who had submitted to the same test could do little more than scrawl Do you reside with your parents? No sir they are dead Where do you live then? In Mott Street Roswell curled his lip when this name was pronounced for Mott Street as my New York readers know is in the immediate neighborhood of the Five-Points and very far from a fashionable locality Have you any testimonials to present? asked Mr Henderson for that was his name Fosdick hesitated This was the question which he had foreseen would give him trouble But at this moment it happened most opportunely that Mr Greyson entered the shop with the intention of buying a hat Yes said Fosdick promptly; I will refer to this gentleman How do you do Fosdick? asked Mr Greyson noticing him for the first time How do you happen to be here? I am applying for a place sir said Fosdick May I refer the gentleman to you? Certainly I shall be glad to speak a good word for you Mr Henderson this is a member of my Sunday-school class of whose good qualities and good abilities I can speak confidently That will be sufficient said the shop-keeper who knew Mr Greysons high character and position He could have no better recommendation You may come to the store to-morrow morning at half past seven oclock The pay will be three dollars a week for the first six months If I am satisfied with you I shall then raise it to five dollars The other boys looked disappointed but none more so than Roswell Crawford He would have cared less if any one else had obtained the situation; but for a boy who lived in Mott Street to be preferred to him a gentlemans son he considered indeed humiliating In a spirit of petty spite he was tempted to say Hes a boot-black Ask him if he isnt Hes an honest and intelligent lad said Mr Greyson As for you young man I only hope you have one-half his good qualities Roswell Crawford left the store in disgust and the other unsuccessful applicants with him What luck Fosdick? asked Dick eagerly as his friend came out of the store Ive got the place said Fosdick in accents of satisfaction; but it was only because Mr Greyson spoke up for me Hes a trump said Dick enthusiastically The gentleman so denominated came out before the boys went away and spoke with them kindly Both Dick and Henry were highly pleased at the success of the application The pay would indeed be small but expended economically Fosdick thought he could get along on it receiving his room rent as before in return for his services as Dicks private tutor Dick determined as soon as his education would permit to follow his companions example I dont know as youll be willin to room with a boot-black he said to Henry now youre goin into business I couldnt room with a better friend Dick said Fosdick affectionately throwing his arm round our hero When we part itll be because you wish it So Fosdick entered upon a new career CHAPTER XX NINE MONTHS LATER The next morning Fosdick rose early put on his new suit and after getting breakfast set out for the Broadway store in which he had obtained a position He left his little blacking-box in the room Itll do to brush my own shoes he said Who knows but I may have to come back to it again? No danger said Dick; Ill take care of the feet and youll have to look after the heads now youre in a hat-store I wish you had a place too said Fosdick I dont know enough yet said Dick Wait till Ive gradooated And can put AB after your name Whats that? It stands for Bachelor of Arts Its a degree that students get when they graduate from college Oh said Dick I didnt know but it meant A Boot-black I can put that after my name now Wouldnt Dick Hunter AB sound tip-top? I must be going said Fosdick It wont do for me to be late the very first morning Thats the difference between you and me said Dick Im my own boss and there aint no one to find fault with me if Im late But I might as well be goin too Theres a gent as comes down to his store pretty early that generally wants a shine The two boys parted at the Park Fosdick crossed it and proceeded to the hat-store while Dick hitching up his pants began to look about him for a customer It was seldom that Dick had to wait long He was always on the alert and if there was any business to do he was always sure to get his share of it He had now a stronger inducement than ever to attend strictly to business; his little stock of money in the savings bank having been nearly exhausted by his liberality to his room-mate He determined to be as economical as possible and moreover to study as hard as he could that he might be able to follow Fosdicks example and obtain a place in a store or counting-room As there were no striking incidents occurring in our heros history within the next nine months I propose to pass over that period and recount the progress he made in that time Fosdick was still at the hat-store having succeeded in giving perfect satisfaction to Mr Henderson His wages had just been raised to five dollars a week He and Dick still kept house together at Mrs Mooneys lodging-house and lived very frugally so that both were able to save up money Dick had been unusually successful in business He had several regular patrons who had been drawn to him by his ready wit and quick humor and from two of them he had received presents of clothing which had saved him any expense on that score His income had averaged quite seven dollars a week in addition to this Of this amount he was now obliged to pay one dollar weekly for the room which he and Fosdick occupied but he was still able to save one half the remainder At the end of nine months therefore or thirty-nine weeks it will be seen that he had accumulated no less a sum than one hundred and seventeen dollars Dick may be excused for feeling like a capitalist when he looked at the long row of deposits in his little bank-book There were other boys in the same business who had earned as much money but they had had little care for the future and spent as they went along so that few could boast a bank-account however small Youll be a rich man some time Dick said Henry Fosdick one evening And live on Fifth Avenoo said Dick Perhaps so Stranger things have happened Well said Dick if such a misfortin should come upon me I should bear it like a man When you see a Fifth Avenoo manshun for sale for a hundred and seventeen dollars just let me know and Ill buy it as an investment Two hundred and fifty years ago you might have bought one for that price probably Real estate wasnt very high among the Indians Just my luck said Dick; I was born too late Id orter have been an Indian and lived in splendor on my present capital Im afraid youd have found your present business rather unprofitable at that time But Dick had gained something more valuable than money He had studied regularly every evening and his improvement had been marvellous He could now read well write a fair hand and had studied arithmetic as far as Interest Besides this he had obtained some knowledge of grammar and geography If some of my boy readers who have been studying for years and got no farther than this should think it incredible that Dick in less than a year and studying evenings only should have accomplished it they must remember that our hero was very much in earnest in his desire to improve He knew that in order to grow up respectable he must be well advanced and he was willing to work But then the reader must not forget that Dick was naturally a smart boy His street education had sharpened his faculties and taught him to rely upon himself He knew that it would take him a long time to reach the goal which he had set before him and he had patience to keep on trying He knew that he had only himself to depend upon and he determined to make the most of himself a resolution which is the secret of success in nine cases out of ten Dick said Fosdick one evening after they had completed their studies I think youll have to get another teacher soon Why? asked Dick in some surprise Have you been offered a more loocrative position? No said Fosdick but I find I have taught you all I know myself You are now as good a scholar as I am Is that true? said Dick eagerly a flush of gratification coloring his brown cheek Yes said Fosdick Youve made wonderful progress I propose now that evening schools have begun that we join one and study together through the winter All right said Dick Id be willin to go now; but when I first began to study I was ashamed to have anybody know that I was so ignorant Do you really mean Fosdick that I know as much as you? Yes Dick its true Then Ive got you to thank for it said Dick earnestly Youve made me what I am And havent you paid me Dick? By payin the room-rent said Dick impulsively Whats that? It isnt half enough I wish youd take half my money; you deserve it Thank you Dick but youre too generous Youve more than paid me Who was it took my part when all the other boys imposed upon me? And who gave me money to buy clothes and so got me my situation? Oh thats nothing! said Dick Its a great deal Dick I shall never forget it But now it seems to me you might try to get a situation yourself Do I know enough? You know as much as I do Then Ill try said Dick decidedly I wish there was a place in our store said Fosdick It would be pleasant for us to be together Never mind said Dick; therell be plenty of other chances Praps A T Stewart might like a partner I wouldnt ask moren a quarter of the profits Which would be a very liberal proposal on your part said Fosdick smiling But perhaps Mr Stewart might object to a partner living on Mott Street Id just as lieves move to Fifth Avenoo said Dick I aint got no prejudices in favor of Mott Street Nor I said Fosdick and in fact I have been thinking it might be a good plan for us to move as soon as we could afford Mrs Mooney doesnt keep the room quite so neat as she might No said Dick She aint got no prejudices against dirt Look at that towel Dick held up the article indicated which had now seen service nearly a week and hard service at that Dicks avocation causing him to be rather hard on towels Yes said Fosdick Ive got about tired of it I guess we can find some better place without having to pay much more When we move you must let me pay my share of the rent Well see about that said Dick Do you propose to move to Fifth Avenoo? Not just at present but to some more agreeable neighborhood than this Well wait till you get a situation and then we can decide A few days later as Dick was looking about for customers in the neighborhood of the Park his attention was drawn to a fellow boot-black a boy about a year younger than himself who appeared to have been crying Whats the matter Tom? asked Dick Havent you had luck to-day? Pretty good said the boy; but were havin hard times at home Mother fell last week and broke her arm and to-morrow weve got to pay the rent and if we dont the landlord says hell turn us out Havent you got anything except what you earn? asked Dick No said Tom not now Mother used to earn three or four dollars a week; but she cant do nothin now and my little sister and brother are too young Dick had quick sympathies He had been so poor himself and obliged to submit to so many privations that he knew from personal experience how hard it was Tom Wilkins he knew as an excellent boy who never squandered his money but faithfully carried it home to his mother In the days of his own extravagance and shiftlessness he had once or twice asked Tom to accompany him to the Old Bowery or Tony Pastors but Tom had always steadily refused Im sorry for you Tom he said How much do you owe for rent? Two weeks now said Tom How much is it a week? Two dollars a week that makes four Have you got anything towards it? No; Ive had to spend all my money for food for mother and the rest of us Ive had pretty hard work to do that I dont know what well do I havent any place to go to and Im afraid motherll get cold in her arm Cant you borrow the money somewhere? asked Dick Tom shook his head despondingly All the people I know are as poor as I am said he Theyd help me if they could but its hard work for them to get along themselves Ill tell you what Tom said Dick impulsively Ill stand your friend Have you got any money? asked Tom doubtfully Got any money! repeated Dick Dont you know that I run a bank on my own account? How much is it you need? Four dollars said Tom If we dont pay that before to-morrow night out we go You havent got as much as that have you? Here are three dollars said Dick drawing out his pocket-book Ill let you have the rest to-morrow and maybe a little more Youre a right down good fellow Dick said Tom; but wont you want it yourself? Oh Ive got some more said Dick Maybe Ill never be able to pay you Spose you dont said Dick; I guess I wont fail I wont forget it Dick I hope Ill be able to do somethin for you sometime All right said Dick Id ought to help you I havent got no mother to look out for I wish I had There was a tinge of sadness in his tone as he pronounced the last four words; but Dicks temperament was sanguine and he never gave way to unavailing sadness Accordingly he began to whistle as he turned away only adding Ill see you to-morrow Tom The three dollars which Dick had handed to Tom Wilkins were his savings for the present week It was now Thursday afternoon His rent which amounted to a dollar he expected to save out of the earnings of Friday and Saturday In order to give Tom the additional assistance he had promised Dick would be obliged to have recourse to his bank-savings He would not have ventured to trench upon it for any other reason but this But he felt that it would be selfish to allow Tom and his mother to suffer when he had it in his power to relieve them But Dick was destined to be surprised and that in a disagreeable manner when he reached home CHAPTER XXI DICK LOSES HIS BANK-BOOK It was hinted at the close of the last chapter that Dick was destined to be disagreeably surprised on reaching home Having agreed to give further assistance to Tom Wilkins he was naturally led to go to the drawer where he and Fosdick kept their bank-books To his surprise and uneasiness _the drawer proved to be empty!_ Come here a minute Fosdick he said Whats the matter Dick? I cant find my bank-book nor yours either Whats come of them? I took mine with me this morning thinking I might want to put in a little more money Ive got it in my pocket now But wheres mine? asked Dick perplexed I dont know I saw it in the drawer when I took mine this morning Are you sure? Yes positive for I looked into it to see how much you had got Did you lock it again? asked Dick Yes; didnt you have to unlock it just now? So I did said Dick But its gone now Somebody opened it with a key that fitted the lock and then locked it agin That must have been the way Its rather hard on a feller said Dick who for the first time since we became acquainted with him began to feel down-hearted Dont give it up Dick You havent lost the money only the bank-book Aint that the same thing? No You can go to the bank to-morrow morning as soon as it opens and tell them you have lost the book and ask them not to pay the money to any one except yourself So I can said Dick brightening up That is if the thief hasnt been to the bank to-day If he has they might detect him by his handwriting Id like to get hold of the one that stole it said Dick indignantly Id give him a good lickin It must have been somebody in the house Suppose we go and see Mrs Mooney She may know whether anybody came into our room to-day The two boys went downstairs and knocked at the door of a little back sitting-room where Mrs Mooney generally spent her evenings It was a shabby little room with a threadbare carpet on the floor the walls covered with a certain large-figured paper patches of which had been stripped off here and there exposing the plaster the remainder being defaced by dirt and grease But Mrs Mooney had one of those comfortable temperaments which are tolerant of dirt and didnt mind it in the least She was seated beside a small pine work-table industriously engaged in mending stockings Good-evening Mrs Mooney said Fosdick politely Good-evening said the landlady Sit down if you can find chairs Im hard at work as you see but a poor lone widder cant afford to be idle We cant stop long Mrs Mooney but my friend here has had something taken from his room to-day and we thought wed come and see you about it What is it? asked the landlady You dont think Id take anything? If I am poor its an honest name Ive always had as all my lodgers can testify Certainly not Mrs Mooney; but there are others in the house that may not be honest My friend has lost his bank-book It was safe in the drawer this morning but to-night it is not to be found How much money was there in it? asked Mrs Mooney Over a hundred dollars said Fosdick It was my whole fortun said Dick I was goin to buy a house next year Mrs Mooney was evidently surprised to learn the extent of Dicks wealth and was disposed to regard him with increased respect Was the drawer locked? she asked Yes Then it couldnt have been Bridget I dont think she has any keys She wouldnt know what a bank-book was said Fosdick You didnt see any of the lodgers go into our room to-day did you? I shouldnt wonder if it was Jim Travis said Mrs Mooney suddenly This James Travis was a bar-tender in a low groggery in Mulberry Street and had been for a few weeks an inmate of Mrs Mooneys lodging-house He was a coarse-looking fellow who from his appearance evidently patronized liberally the liquor he dealt out to others He occupied a room opposite Dicks and was often heard by the two boys reeling upstairs in a state of intoxication uttering shocking oaths This Travis had made several friendly overtures to Dick and his room-mate and had invited them to call round at the bar-room where he tended and take something But this invitation had never been accepted partly because the boys were better engaged in the evening and partly because neither of them had taken a fancy to Mr Travis; which certainly was not strange for nature had not gifted him with many charms either of personal appearance or manners The rejection of his friendly proffers had caused him to take a dislike to Dick and Henry whom he considered stiff and unsocial What makes you think it was Travis? asked Fosdick He isnt at home in the daytime But he was to-day He said he had got a bad cold and had to come home for a clean handkerchief Did you see him? asked Dick Yes said Mrs Mooney Bridget was hanging out clothes and I went to the door to let him in I wonder if he had a key that would fit our drawer said Fosdick Yes said Mrs Mooney The bureaus in the two rooms are just alike I got em at auction and most likely the locks is the same It must have been he said Dick looking towards Fosdick Yes said Fosdick it looks like it Whats to be done? Thats what Id like to know said Dick Of course hell say he hasnt got it; and he wont be such a fool as to leave it in his room If he hasnt been to the bank its all right said Fosdick You can go there the first thing to-morrow morning and stop their paying any money on it But I cant get any money on it myself said Dick I told Tom Wilkins Id let him have some more money to-morrow or his sick motherll have to turn out of their lodgins How much money were you going to give him? I gave him three dollars to-day and was goin to give him two dollars to-morrow Ive got the money Dick I didnt go to the bank this morning All right Ill take it and pay you back next week No Dick; if youve given three dollars you must let me give two No Fosdick Id rather give the whole You know Ive got more money than you No I havent either said Dick the memory of his loss flashing upon him I thought I was rich this morning but now Im in destitoot circumstances Cheer up Dick; youll get your money back I hope so said our hero rather ruefully The fact was that our friend Dick was beginning to feel what is so often experienced by men who do business of a more important character and on a larger scale than he the bitterness of a reverse of circumstances With one hundred dollars and over carefully laid away in the savings bank he had felt quite independent Wealth is comparative and Dick probably felt as rich as many men who are worth a hundred thousand dollars He was beginning to feel the advantages of his steady self-denial and to experience the pleasures of property Not that Dick was likely to be unduly attached to money Let it be said to his credit that it had never given him so much satisfaction as when it enabled him to help Tom Wilkins in his trouble Besides this there was another thought that troubled him When he obtained a place he could not expect to receive as much as he was now making from blacking boots probably not more than three dollars a week while his expenses without clothing would amount to four dollars To make up the deficiency he had confidently relied upon his savings which would be sufficient to carry him along for a year if necessary If he should not recover his money he would be compelled to continue a boot-black for at least six months longer; and this was rather a discouraging reflection On the whole it is not to be wondered at that Dick felt unusually sober this evening and that neither of the boys felt much like studying The two boys consulted as to whether it would be best to speak to Travis about it It was not altogether easy to decide Fosdick was opposed to it It will only put him on his guard said he and I dont see as it will do any good Of course he will deny it Wed better keep quiet and watch him and by giving notice at the bank we can make sure that he doesnt get any money on it If he does present himself at the bank they will know at once that he is a thief and he can be arrested This view seemed reasonable and Dick resolved to adopt it On the whole he began to think prospects were brighter than he had at first supposed and his spirits rose a little Howd he know I had any bank-book? Thats what I cant make out he said Dont you remember? said Fosdick after a moments thought we were speaking of our savings two or three evenings since? Yes said Dick Our door was a little open at the time and I heard somebody come upstairs and stop a minute in front of it It must have been Jim Travis In that way he probably found out about your money and took the opportunity to-day to get hold of it This might or might not be the correct explanation At all events it seemed probable The boys were just on the point of going to bed later in the evening when a knock was heard at the door and to their no little surprise their neighbor Jim Travis proved to be the caller He was a sallow-complexioned young man with dark hair and bloodshot eyes He darted a quick glance from one to the other as he entered which did not escape the boys notice How are ye to-night? he said sinking into one of the two chairs with which the room was scantily furnished Jolly said Dick How are you? Tired as a dog was the reply Hard work and poor pay; thats the way with me I wanted to go to the theater to-night but I was hard up and couldnt raise the cash Here he darted another quick glance at the boys; but neither betrayed anything You dont go out much do you? he said Not much said Fosdick We spend our evenings in study Thats precious slow said Travis rather contemptuously Whats the use of studying so much? You dont expect to be a lawyer do you or anything of that sort? Maybe said Dick I havent made up my mind yet If my feller-citizens should want me to go to Congress some time I shouldnt want to disappint em; and then readin and writin might come handy Well said Travis rather abruptly Im tired and I guess Ill turn in Good-night said Fosdick The boys looked at each other as their visitor left the room He came in to see if wed missed the bank-book said Dick And to turn off suspicion from himself by letting us know he had no money added Fosdick Thats so said Dick Id like to have searched them pockets of his CHAPTER XXII TRACKING THE THIEF Fosdick was right in supposing that Jim Travis had stolen the bank-book He was also right in supposing that that worthy young man had come to the knowledge of Dicks savings by what he had accidentally overheard Now Travis like a very large number of young men of his class was able to dispose of a larger amount of money than he was able to earn Moreover he had no great fancy for work at all and would have been glad to find some other way of obtaining money enough to pay his expenses He had recently received a letter from an old companion who had strayed out to California and going at once to the mines had been lucky enough to get possession of a very remunerative claim He wrote to Travis that he had already realized two thousand dollars from it and expected to make his fortune within six months Two thousand dollars! This seemed to Travis a very large sum and quite dazzled his imagination He was at once inflamed with the desire to go out to California and try his luck In his present situation he only received thirty dollars a month which was probably all that his services were worth but went a very little way towards gratifying his expensive tastes Accordingly he determined to take the next steamer to the land of gold if he could possibly manage to get money enough to pay the passage The price of a steerage passage at that time was seventy-five dollars not a large sum certainly but it might as well have been seventy-five hundred for any chance James Travis had of raising the amount at present His available funds consisted of precisely two dollars and a quarter; of which sum one dollar and a half was due to his washerwoman This however would not have troubled Travis much and he would conveniently have forgotten all about it; but even leaving this debt unpaid the sum at his command would not help him materially towards paying his passage money Travis applied for help to two or three of his companions; but they were all of that kind who never keep an account with savings banks but carry all their spare cash about with them One of these friends offered to lend him thirty-seven cents and another a dollar; but neither of these offers seemed to encourage him much He was about giving up his project in despair when he learned accidentally as we have already said the extent of Dicks savings One hundred and seventeen dollars! Why that would not only pay his passage but carry him up to the mines after he had arrived in San Francisco He could not help thinking it over and the result of this thinking was that he determined to borrow it of Dick without leave Knowing that neither of the boys were in their room in the daytime he came back in the course of the morning and being admitted by Mrs Mooney herself said by way of accounting for his presence that he had a cold and had come back for a handkerchief The landlady suspected nothing and returning at once to her work in the kitchen left the coast clear Travis at once entered Dicks room and as there seemed to be no other place for depositing money tried the bureau-drawers They were all readily opened except one which proved to be locked This he naturally concluded must contain the money and going back to his own chamber for the key of the bureau tried it on his return and found to his satisfaction that it would fit When he discovered the bank-book his joy was mingled with disappointment He had expected to find bank-bills instead This would have saved all further trouble and would have been immediately available Obtaining money at the savings bank would involve fresh risk Travis hesitated whether to take it or not; but finally decided that it would be worth the trouble and hazard He accordingly slipped the book into his pocket locked the drawer again and forgetting all about the handkerchief for which he had come home went downstairs and into the street There would have been time to go to the savings bank that day but Travis had already been absent from his place of business some time and did not venture to take the additional time required Besides not being very much used to savings banks never having had occasion to use them he thought it would be more prudent to look over the rules and regulations and see if he could not get some information as to the way he ought to proceed So the day passed and Dicks money was left in safety at the bank In the evening it occurred to Travis that it might be well to find out whether Dick had discovered his loss This reflection it was that induced the visit which is recorded at the close of the last chapter The result was that he was misled by the boys silence on the subject and concluded that nothing had yet been discovered Good! thought Travis with satisfaction If they dont find out for twenty-four hours itll be too late then and I shall be all right There being a possibility of the loss being discovered before the boys went out in the morning Travis determined to see them at that time and judge whether such was the case He waited therefore until he heard the boys come out and then opened his own door Morning gents said he sociably Going to business? Yes said Dick Im afraid my clerksll be lazy if I aint on hand Good joke! said Travis If you pay good wages Id like to speak for a place I pay all I get myself said Dick Hows business with you? So so Why dont you call round some time? All my evenins is devoted to literatoor and science said Dick Thank you all the same Where do you hang out? inquired Travis in choice language addressing Fosdick At Hendersons hat and cap store on Broadway Ill look in upon you some time when I want a tile said Travis I suppose you sell cheaper to your friends Ill be as reasonable as I can said Fosdick not very cordially; for he did not much fancy having it supposed by his employer that such a disreputable-looking person as Travis was a friend of his However Travis had no idea of showing himself at the Broadway store and only said this by way of making conversation and encouraging the boys to be social You havent any of you gents seen a pearl-handled knife have you? he asked No said Fosdick; have you lost one? Yes said Travis with unblushing falsehood I left it on my bureau a day or two since Ive missed one or two other little matters Bridget dont look to me any too honest Likely shes got em What are you goin to do about it? said Dick Ill keep mum unless I lose something more and then Ill kick up a row and haul her over the coals Have you missed anything? No said Fosdick answering for himself as he could do without violating the truth There was a gleam of satisfaction in the eyes of Travis as he heard this They havent found it out yet he thought Ill bag the money to-day and then they may whistle for it Having no further object to serve in accompanying the boys he bade them good-morning and turned down another street Hes mighty friendly all of a sudden said Dick Yes said Fosdick; its very evident what it all means He wants to find out whether you have discovered your loss or not But he didnt find out No; weve put him on the wrong track He means to get his money to-day no doubt My money suggested Dick I accept the correction said Fosdick Of course Dick youll be on hand as soon as the bank opens In course I shall Jim Travisll find hes walked into the wrong shop The bank opens at ten oclock you know Ill be there on time The two boys separated Good luck Dick said Fosdick as he parted from him Itll all come out right I think I hope twill said Dick He had recovered from his temporary depression and made up his mind that the money would be recovered He had no idea of allowing himself to be outwitted by Jim Travis and enjoyed already in anticipation the pleasure of defeating his rascality It wanted two hours and a half yet to ten oclock and this time to Dick was too precious to be wasted It was the time of his greatest harvest He accordingly repaired to his usual place of business succeeded in obtaining six customers which yielded him sixty cents He then went to a restaurant and got some breakfast It was now half-past nine and Dick feeling that it wouldnt do to be late left his box in charge of Johnny Nolan and made his way to the bank The officers had not yet arrived and Dick lingered on the outside waiting till they should come He was not without a little uneasiness fearing that Travis might be as prompt as himself and finding him there might suspect something and so escape the snare But though looking cautiously up and down the street he could discover no traces of the supposed thief In due time ten oclock struck and immediately afterwards the doors of the bank were thrown open and our hero entered As Dick had been in the habit of making a weekly visit for the last nine months the cashier had come to know him by sight Youre early this morning my lad he said pleasantly Have you got some more money to deposit? Youll be getting rich soon I dont know about that said Dick My bank-books been stole Stolen! echoed the cashier Thats unfortunate Not so bad as it might be though The thief cant collect the money Thats what I came to see about said Dick I was afraid he might have got it already He hasnt been here yet Even if he had I remember you and should have detected him When was it taken? Yesterday said Dick I missed it in the evenin when I got home Have you any suspicion as to the person who took it? asked the cashier Dick thereupon told all he knew as to the general character and suspicious conduct of Jim Travis and the cashier agreed with him that he was probably the thief Dick also gave his reason for thinking that he would visit the bank that morning to withdraw the funds Very good said the cashier Well be ready for him What is the number of your book? No 5678 said Dick Now give me a little description of this Travis whom you suspect Dick accordingly furnished a brief outline sketch of Travis not particularly complimentary to the latter That will answer I think I shall know him said the cashier You may depend upon it that he shall receive no money on your account Thank you said Dick Considerably relieved in mind our hero turned towards the door thinking that there would be nothing gained by his remaining longer while he would of course lose time He had just reached the doors which were of glass when through them he perceived James Travis himself just crossing the street and apparently coming towards the bank It would not do of course for him to be seen Here he is he exclaimed hurrying back Cant you hide me somewhere? I dont want to be seen The cashier understood at once how the land lay He quickly opened a little door and admitted Dick behind the counter Stoop down he said so as not to be seen Dick had hardly done so when Jim Travis opened the outer door and looking about him in a little uncertainty walked up to the cashiers desk CHAPTER XXIII TRAVIS IS ARRESTED Jim Travis advanced into the bank with a doubtful step knowing well that he was on a dishonest errand and heartily wishing that he were well out of it After a little hesitation he approached the paying-teller and exhibiting the bank-book said I want to get my money out The bank-officer took the book and after looking at it a moment said How much do you want? The whole of it said Travis You can draw out any part of it but to draw out the whole requires a weeks notice Then Ill take a hundred dollars Are you the person to whom the book belongs? Yes sir said Travis without hesitation Your name is Hunter The bank-clerk went to a large folio volume containing the names of depositors and began to turn over the leaves While he was doing this he managed to send out a young man connected with the bank for a policeman Travis did not perceive this or did not suspect that it had anything to do with himself Not being used to savings banks he supposed the delay only what was usual After a search which was only intended to gain time that a policeman might be summoned the cashier came back and sliding out a piece of paper to Travis said It will be necessary for you to write an order for the money Travis took a pen which he found on the ledge outside and wrote the order signing his name Dick Hunter having observed that name on the outside of the book Your name is Dick Hunter then? said the cashier taking the paper and looking at the thief over his spectacles Yes said Travis promptly But continued the cashier I find Hunters age is put down on the bank-book as fourteen Surely you must be more than that Travis would gladly have declared that he was only fourteen; but being in reality twenty-three and possessing a luxuriant pair of whiskers this was not to be thought of He began to feel uneasy Dick Hunters my younger brother he said Im getting out the money for him I thought you said your own name was Dick Hunter said the cashier I said my name was Hunter said Travis ingeniously I didnt understand you But youve signed the name of Dick Hunter to this order How is that? questioned the troublesome cashier Travis saw that he was getting himself into a tight place; but his self-possession did not desert him I thought I must give my brothers name he answered What is your own name? Henry Hunter Can you bring any one to testify that the statement you are making is correct? Yes a dozen if you like said Travis boldly Give me the book and Ill come back this afternoon I didnt think thered be such a fuss about getting out a little money Wait a moment Why dont your brother come himself? Because hes sick Hes down with the measles said Travis Here the cashier signed to Dick to rise and show himself Our hero accordingly did so You will be glad to find that he has recovered said the cashier pointing to Dick With an exclamation of anger and dismay Travis who saw the game was up started for the door feeling that safety made such a course prudent But he was too late He found himself confronted by a burly policeman who seized him by the arm saying Not so fast my man I want you Let me go exclaimed Travis struggling to free himself Im sorry I cant oblige you said the officer Youd better not make a fuss or I may have to hurt you a little Travis sullenly resigned himself to his fate darting a look of rage at Dick whom he considered the author of his present misfortune This is your book said the cashier handing back his rightful property to our hero Do you wish to draw out any money? Two dollars said Dick Very well Write an order for the amount Before doing so Dick who now that he saw Travis in the power of the law began to pity him went up to the officer and said Wont you let him go? Ive got my bank-book back and I dont want anything done to him Sorry I cant oblige you said the officer; but Im not allowed to do it Hell have to stand his trial Im sorry for you Travis said Dick I didnt want you arrested I only wanted my bank-book back Curse you! said Travis scowling vindictively Wait till I get free See if I dont fix you You neednt pity him too much said the officer I know him now Hes been to the Island before Its a lie said Travis violently Dont be too noisy my friend said the officer If youve got no more business here well be going He withdrew with the prisoner in charge and Dick having drawn his two dollars left the bank Notwithstanding the violent words the prisoner had used towards himself and his attempted robbery he could not help feeling sorry that he had been instrumental in causing his arrest Ill keep my book a little safer hereafter thought Dick Now I must go and see Tom Wilkins Before dismissing the subject of Travis and his theft it may be remarked that he was duly tried and his guilt being clear was sent to Blackwells Island for nine months At the end of that time on his release he got a chance to work his passage on a ship to San Francisco where he probably arrived in due time At any rate nothing more has been heard of him and probably his threat of vengence against Dick will never be carried into effect Returning to the City Hall Park Dick soon fell in with Tom Wilkins How are you Tom? he said Hows your mother? Shes better Dick thank you She felt worried about bein turned out into the street; but I gave her that money from you and now she feels a good deal easier Ive got some more for you Tom said Dick producing a two-dollar bill from his pocket I ought not to take it from you Dick Oh its all right Tom Dont be afraid But you may need it yourself Theres plenty more where that came from Any way one dollar will be enough With that we can pay the rent Youll want the other to buy something to eat Youre very kind Dick Id ought to be Ive only got myself to take care of Well Ill take it for my mothers sake When you want anything done just call on Tom Wilkins All right Next week if your mother doesnt get better Ill give you some more Tom thanked our hero very gratefully and Dick walked away feeling the self-approval which always accompanies a generous and disinterested action He was generous by nature and before the period at which he is introduced to the readers notice he frequently treated his friends to cigars and oyster-stews Sometimes he invited them to accompany him to the theatre at his expense But he never derived from these acts of liberality the same degree of satisfaction as from this timely gift to Tom Wilkins He felt that his money was well bestowed and would save an entire family from privation and discomfort Five dollars would to be sure make something of a difference in the amount of his savings It was more than he was able to save up in a week But Dick felt fully repaid for what he had done and he felt prepared to give as much more if Toms mother should continue to be sick and should appear to him to need it Besides all this Dick felt a justifiable pride in his financial ability to afford so handsome a gift A year before however much he might have desired to give it would have been quite out of his power to give five dollars His cash balance never reached that amount It was seldom indeed that it equalled one dollar In more ways than one Dick was beginning to reap the advantage of his self-denial and judicious economy It will be remembered that when Mr Whitney at parting with Dick presented him with five dollars he told him that he might repay it to some other boy who was struggling upward Dick thought of this and it occurred to him that after all he was only paying up an old debt When Fosdick came home in the evening Dick announced his success in recovering his lost money and described the manner it had been brought about Youre in luck said Fosdick I guess wed better not trust the bureau-drawer again I mean to carry my book round with me said Dick So shall I as long as we stay at Mrs Mooneys I wish we were in a better place I must go down and tell her she neednt expect Travis back Poor chap I pity him! Travis was never more seen in Mrs Mooneys establishment He was owing that lady for a fortnights rent of his room which prevented her feeling much compassion for him The room was soon after let to a more creditable tenant who proved a less troublesome neighbor than his predecessor CHAPTER XXIV DICK RECEIVES A LETTER It was about a week after Dicks recovery of his bank-book that Fosdick brought home with him in the evening a copy of the Daily Sun Would you like to see your name in print Dick? he asked Yes said Dick who was busy at the wash-stand endeavoring to efface the marks which his days work had left upon his hands They havent put me up for mayor have they? Cause if they have I shant accept It would interfere too much with my private business No said Fosdick they havent put you up for office yet though that may happen sometime But if you want to see your name in print here it is Dick was rather incredulous but having dried his hands on the towel took the paper and following the directions of Fosdicks finger observed in the list of advertised letters the name of RAGGED DICK By gracious so it is said he Do you spose it means me? I dont know of any other Ragged Dick do you? No said Dick reflectively; it must be me But I dont know of anybody that would be likely to write to me Perhaps it is Frank Whitney suggested Fosdick after a little reflection Didnt he promise to write to you? Yes said Dick and he wanted me to write to him Where is he now? He was going to a boarding-school in Connecticut he said The name of the town was Barnton Very likely the letter is from him I hope it is Frank was a tip-top boy and he was the first that made me ashamed of bein so ignorant and dirty You had better go to the post-office to-morrow morning and ask for the letter Praps they wont give it to me Suppose you wear the old clothes you used to a year ago when Frank first saw you? They wont have any doubt of your being Ragged Dick then I guess I will Ill be sort of ashamed to be seen in em though said Dick who had considerable more pride in a neat personal appearance than when we were first introduced to him It will be only for one day or one morning said Fosdick Id do moren that for the sake of gettin a letter from Frank Id like to see him The next morning in accordance with the suggestion of Fosdick Dick arrayed himself in the long disused Washington coat and Napoleon pants which he had carefully preserved for what reason he could hardly explain When fairly equipped Dick surveyed himself in the mirror if the little seven-by-nine-inch looking-glass with which the room was furnished deserved the name The result of the survey was not on the whole a pleasing one To tell the truth Dick was quite ashamed of his appearance and on opening the chamber-door looked around to see that the coast was clear not being willing to have any of his fellow-boarders see him in his present attire He managed to slip out into the street unobserved and after attending to two or three regular customers who came down-town early in the morning he made his way down Nassau Street to the post-office He passed along until he came to a compartment on which he read ADVERTISED LETTERS and stepping up to the little window said Theres a letter for me I saw it advertised in the Sun yesterday What name? demanded the clerk Ragged Dick answered our hero Thats a queer name said the clerk surveying him a little curiously Are you Ragged Dick? If you dont believe me look at my cloes said Dick Thats pretty good proof certainly said the clerk laughing If that isnt your name it deserves to be I believe in dressin up to your name said Dick Do you know any one in Barnton Connecticut? asked the clerk who had by this time found the letter Yes said Dick I know a chap thats at boardin-school there It appears to be in a boys hand I think it must be yours The letter was handed to Dick through the window He received it eagerly and drawing back so as not to be in the way of the throng who were constantly applying for letters or slipping them into the boxes provided for them hastily opened it and began to read As the reader may be interested in the contents of the letter as well as Dick we transcribe it below It was dated Barnton Conn and commenced thus DEAR DICK You must excuse my addressing this letter to Ragged Dick; but the fact is I dont know what your last name is nor where you live I am afraid there is not much chance of your getting this letter; but I hope you will I have thought of you very often and wondered how you were getting along and I should have written to you before if I had known where to direct Let me tell you a little about myself Barnton is a very pretty country town only about six miles from Hartford The boarding-school which I attend is under the charge of Ezekiel Munroe AM He is a man of about fifty a graduate of Yale College and has always been a teacher It is a large two-story house with an addition containing a good many small bed-chambers for the boys There are about twenty of us and there is one assistant teacher who teaches the English branches Mr Munroe or Old Zeke as we call him behind his back teaches Latin and Greek I am studying both these languages because father wants me to go to college But you wont be interested in hearing about our studies I will tell you how we amuse ourselves There are about fifty acres of land belonging to Mr Munroe; so that we have plenty of room for play About a quarter of a mile from the house there is a good-sized pond There is a large round-bottomed boat which is stout and strong Every Wednesday and Saturday afternoon when the weather is good we go out rowing on the pond Mr Barton the assistant teacher goes with us to look after us In the summer we are allowed to go in bathing In the winter there is splendid skating on the pond Besides this we play ball a good deal and we have various other plays So we have a pretty good time although we study pretty hard too I am getting on very well in my studies Father has not decided yet where he will send me to college I wish you were here Dick I should enjoy your company and besides I should like to feel that you were getting an education I think you are naturally a pretty smart boy; but I suppose as you have to earn your own living you dont get much chance to learn I only wish I had a few hundred dollars of my own I would have you come up here and attend school with us If I ever have a chance to help you in any way you may be sure that I will I shall have to wind up my letter now as I have to hand in a composition to-morrow on the life and character of Washington I might say that I have a friend who wears a coat that once belonged to the general But I suppose that coat must be worn out by this time I dont much like writing compositions I would a good deal rather write letters I have written a longer letter than I meant to I hope you will get it though I am afraid not If you do you must be sure to answer it as soon as possible You neednt mind if your writing does look like hens-tracks as you told me once Good-by Dick You must always think of me as your very true friend FRANK WHITNEY Dick read this letter with much satisfaction It is always pleasant to be remembered and Dick had so few friends that it was more to him than to boys who are better provided Again he felt a new sense of importance in having a letter addressed to him It was the first letter he had ever received If it had been sent to him a year before he would not have been able to read it But now thanks to Fosdicks instructions he could not only read writing but he could write a very good hand himself There was one passage in the letter which pleased Dick It was where Frank said that if he had the money he would pay for his education himself Hes a tip-top feller said Dick I wish I could see him agin There were two reasons why Dick would like to have seen Frank One was the natural pleasure he would have in meeting a friend; but he felt also that he would like to have Frank witness the improvement he had made in his studies and mode of life Hed find me a little more spectable than when he first saw me thought Dick Dick had by this time got up to Printing House Square Standing on Spruce Street near the Tribune office was his old enemy Micky Maguire It has already been said that Micky felt a natural enmity towards those in his own condition in life who wore better clothes than himself For the last nine months Dicks neat appearance had excited the ire of the young Philistine To appear in neat attire and with a clean face Micky felt was a piece of presumption and an assumption of superiority on the part of our hero and he termed it tryin to be a swell Now his astonished eyes rested on Dick in his ancient attire which was very similar to his own It was a moment of triumph to him He felt that pride had had a fall and he could not forbear reminding Dick of it Thems nice cloes youve got on said he sarcastically as Dick came up Yes said Dick promptly Ive been employin your tailor If my face was only dirty wed be taken for twin brothers So youve give up tryin to be a swell? Only for this particlar occasion said Dick I wanted to make a fashionable call so I put on my regimentals I dont blieve youve got any better cloes said Micky All right said Dick I wont charge you nothin for what you believe Here a customer presented himself for Micky and Dick went back to his room to change his clothes before resuming business CHAPTER XXV DICK WRITES HIS FIRST LETTER When Fosdick reached home in the evening Dick displayed his letter with some pride Its a nice letter said Fosdick after reading it I should like to know Frank Ill bet you would said Dick Hes a trump When are you going to answer it? I dont know said Dick dubiously I never writ a letter Thats no reason why you shouldnt Theres always a first time you know I dont know what to say said Dick Get some paper and sit down to it and youll find enough to say You can do that this evening instead of studying If youll look it over afterwards and shine it up a little Yes if it needs it; but I rather think Frank would like it best just as you wrote it Dick decided to adopt Fosdicks suggestion He had very serious doubts as to his ability to write a letter Like a good many other boys he looked upon it as a very serious job not reflecting that after all letter-writing is nothing but talking upon paper Still in spite of his misgivings he felt that the letter ought to be answered and he wished Frank to hear from him After various preparations he at last got settled down to his task and before the evening was over a letter was written As the first letter which Dick had ever produced and because it was characteristic of him my readers may like to read it Here it is DEAR FRANK I got your letter this mornin and was very glad to hear you hadnt forgotten Ragged Dick I aint so ragged as I was Openwork coats and trowsers has gone out of fashion I put on the Washington coat and Napoleon pants to go to the post-office for fear they wouldnt think I was the boy that was meant On my way back I received the congratulations of my intimate friend Micky Maguire on my improved appearance Ive give up sleepin in boxes and old wagons findin it didnt agree with my constitution Ive hired a room in Mott Street and have got a private tooter who rooms with me and looks after my studies in the evenin Mott Street aint very fashionable; but my manshun on Fifth Avenoo isnt finished yet and Im afraid it wont be till Im a gray-haired veteran Ive got a hundred dollars towards it which Ive saved up from my earnins I havent forgot what you and your uncle said to me and Im tryin to grow up spectable I havent been to Tony Pastors or the Old Bowery for ever so long Id rather save up my money to support me in my old age When my hair gets gray Im goin to knock off blackin boots and go into some light genteel employment such as keepin an apple-stand or disseminatin pea-nuts among the people Ive got so as to read pretty well so my tooter says Ive been studyin geography and grammar also Ive made such astonishin progress that I can tell a noun from a conjunction as far away as I can see em Tell Mr Munroe that if he wants an accomplished teacher in his school he can send for me and Ill come on by the very next train Or if he wants to sell out for a hundred dollars Ill buy the whole concern and agree to teach the scholars all I know myself in less than six months Is teachin as good business generally speakin as blackin boots? My private tooter combines both and is makin a fortun with great rapidity Hell be as rich as Astor some time _if he only lives long enough_ I should think youd have a bully time at your school I should like to go out in the boat or play ball with you When are you comin to the city? I wish youd write and let me know when you do and Ill call and see you Ill leave my business in the hands of my numerous clerks and go round with you Theres lots of things you didnt see when you was here before Theyre getting on fast at the Central Park It looks better than it did a year ago I aint much used to writin letters As this is the first one I ever wrote I hope youll excuse the mistakes I hope youll write to me again soon I cant write so good a letter as you; but Ill do my best as the man said when he was asked if he could swim over to Brooklyn backwards Good-by Frank Thank you for all your kindness Direct your next letter to No Mott Street Your true friend DICK HUNTER When Dick had written the last word he leaned back in his chair and surveyed the letter with much satisfaction I didnt think I could have wrote such a long letter Fosdick said he Written would be more grammatical Dick suggested his friend I guess theres plenty of mistakes in it said Dick Just look at it and see Fosdick took the letter and read it over carefully Yes there are some mistakes he said; but it sounds so much like you that I think it would be better to let it go just as it is It will be more likely to remind Frank of what you were when he first saw you Is it good enough to send? asked Dick anxiously Yes; it seems to me to be quite a good letter It is written just as you talk Nobody but you could have written such a letter Dick I think Frank will be amused at your proposal to come up there as teacher Praps it would be a good idea for us to open a seleck school here in Mott Street said Dick humorously We could call it Professor Fosdick and Hunters Mott Street Seminary Boot-blackin taught by Professor Hunter The evening was so far advanced that Dick decided to postpone copying his letter till the next evening By this time he had come to have a very fair handwriting so that when the letter was complete it really looked quite creditable and no one would have suspected that it was Dicks first attempt in this line Our hero surveyed it with no little complacency In fact he felt rather proud of it since it reminded him of the great progress he had made He carried it down to the post-office and deposited it with his own hands in the proper box Just on the steps of the building as he was coming out he met Johnny Nolan who had been sent on an errand to Wall Street by some gentleman and was just returning What are you doin down here Dick? asked Johnny Ive been mailin a letter Who sent you? Nobody I mean who writ the letter? I wrote it myself Can you write letters? asked Johnny in amazement Why shouldnt I? I didnt know you could write I cant Then you ought to learn I went to school once; but it was too hard work so I give it up Youre lazy Johnny thats whats the matter Howd you ever expect to know anything if you dont try? I cant learn You can if you want to Johnny Nolan was evidently of a different opinion He was a good-natured boy large of his age with nothing particularly bad about him but utterly lacking in that energy ambition and natural sharpness for which Dick was distinguished He was not adapted to succeed in the life which circumstances had forced upon him; for in the street-life of the metropolis a boy needs to be on the alert and have all his wits about him or he will find himself wholly distanced by his more enterprising competitors for popular favor To succeed in his profession humble as it is a boot-black must depend upon the same qualities which gain success in higher walks in life It was easy to see that Johnny unless very much favored by circumstances would never rise much above his present level For Dick we cannot help hoping much better things CHAPTER XXVI AN EXCITING ADVENTURE Dick now began to look about for a position in a store or counting-room Until he should obtain one he determined to devote half the day to blacking boots not being willing to break in upon his small capital He found that he could earn enough in half a day to pay all his necessary expenses including the entire rent of the room Fosdick desired to pay his half; but Dick steadily refused insisting upon paying so much as compensation for his friends services as instructor It should be added that Dicks peculiar way of speaking and use of slang terms had been somewhat modified by his education and his intimacy with Henry Fosdick Still he continued to indulge in them to some extent especially when he felt like joking and it was natural to Dick to joke as my readers have probably found out by this time Still his manners were considerably improved so that he was more likely to obtain a situation than when first introduced to our notice Just now however business was very dull and merchants instead of hiring new assistants were disposed to part with those already in their employ After making several ineffectual applications Dick began to think he should be obliged to stick to his profession until the next season But about this time something occurred which considerably improved his chances of preferment This is the way it happened As Dick with a balance of more than a hundred dollars in the savings bank might fairly consider himself a young man of property he thought himself justified in occasionally taking a half holiday from business and going on an excursion On Wednesday afternoon Henry Fosdick was sent by his employer on an errand to that part of Brooklyn near Greenwood Cemetery Dick hastily dressed himself in his best and determined to accompany him The two boys walked down to the South Ferry and paying their two cents each entered the ferry boat They remained at the stern and stood by the railing watching the great city with its crowded wharves receding from view Beside them was a gentleman with two children a girl of eight and a little boy of six The children were talking gayly to their father While he was pointing out some object of interest to the little girl the boy managed to creep unobserved beneath the chain that extends across the boat for the protection of passengers and stepping incautiously to the edge of the boat fell over into the foaming water At the childs scream the father looked up and with a cry of horror sprang to the edge of the boat He would have plunged in but being unable to swim would only have endangered his own life without being able to save his child My child! he exclaimed in anguish who will save my child? A thousand ten thousand dollars to any one who will save him! There chanced to be but few passengers on board at the time and nearly all these were either in the cabins or standing forward Among the few who saw the child fall was our hero Now Dick was an expert swimmer It was an accomplishment which he had possessed for years and he no sooner saw the boy fall than he resolved to rescue him His determination was formed before he heard the liberal offer made by the boys father Indeed I must do Dick the justice to say that in the excitement of the moment he did not hear it at all nor would it have stimulated the alacrity with which he sprang to the rescue of the little boy Little Johnny had already risen once and gone under for the second time when our hero plunged in He was obliged to strike out for the boy and this took time He reached him none too soon Just as he was sinking for the third and last time he caught him by the jacket Dick was stout and strong but Johnny clung to him so tightly that it was with great difficulty he was able to sustain himself Put your arms round my neck said Dick The little boy mechanically obeyed and clung with a grasp strengthened by his terror In this position Dick could bear his weight better But the ferry-boat was receding fast It was quite impossible to reach it The father his face pale with terror and anguish and his hands clasped in suspense saw the brave boys struggles and prayed with agonizing fervor that he might be successful But it is probable for they were now midway of the river that both Dick and the little boy whom he had bravely undertaken to rescue would have been drowned had not a row-boat been fortunately near The two men who were in it witnessed the accident and hastened to the rescue of our hero Keep up a little longer they shouted bending to their oars and we will save you Dick heard the shout and it put fresh strength into him He battled manfully with the treacherous sea his eyes fixed longingly upon the approaching boat Hold on tight little boy he said Theres a boat coming The little boy did not see the boat His eyes were closed to shut out the fearful water but he clung the closer to his young preserver Six long steady strokes and the boat dashed along side Strong hands seized Dick and his youthful burden and drew them into the boat both dripping with water God be thanked! exclaimed the father as from the steamer he saw the childs rescue That brave boy shall be rewarded if I sacrifice my whole fortune to compass it Youve had a pretty narrow escape young chap said one of the boatmen to Dick It was a pretty tough job you undertook Yes said Dick Thats what I thought when I was in the water If it hadnt been for you I dont know what would have come of us Anyhow youre a plucky boy or you wouldnt have dared to jump into the water after this little chap It was a risky thing to do Im used to the water said Dick modestly I didnt stop to think of the danger but I wasnt going to see that little fellow drown without tryin to save him The boat at once headed for the ferry wharf on the Brooklyn side The captain of the ferry-boat seeing the rescue did not think it necessary to stop his boat but kept on his way The whole occurrence took place in less time than I have occupied in telling it The father was waiting on the wharf to receive his little boy with what feelings of gratitude and joy can be easily understood With a burst of happy tears he clasped him to his arms Dick was about to withdraw modestly but the gentleman perceived the movement and putting down the child came forward and clasping his hand said with emotion My brave boy I owe you a debt I can never repay But for your timely service I should now be plunged into an anguish which I cannot think of without a shudder Our hero was ready enough to speak on most occasions but always felt awkward when he was praised It wasnt any trouble he said modestly I can swim like a top But not many boys would have risked their lives for a stranger said the gentleman But he added with a sudden thought as his glance rested on Dicks dripping garments both you and my little boy will take cold in wet clothes Fortunately I have a friend living close at hand at whose house you will have an opportunity of taking off your clothes and having them dried Dick protested that he never took cold; but Fosdick who had now joined them and who it is needless to say had been greatly alarmed at Dicks danger joined in urging compliance with the gentlemans proposal and in the end our hero had to yield His new friend secured a hack the driver of which agreed for extra recompense to receive the dripping boys into his carriage and they were whirled rapidly to a pleasant house in a side street where matters were quickly explained and both boys were put to bed I aint used to goin to bed quite so early thought Dick This is the queerest excursion I ever took Like most active boys Dick did not enjoy the prospect of spending half a day in bed; but his confinement did not last as long as he anticipated In about an hour the door of his chamber was opened and a servant appeared bringing a new and handsome suit of clothes throughout You are to put on these said the servant to Dick; but you neednt get up till you feel like it Whose clothes are they? asked Dick They are yours Mine! Where did they come from? Mr Rockwell sent out and bought them for you They are the same size as your wet ones Is he here now? No He bought another suit for the little boy and has gone back to New York Heres a note he asked me to give you Dick opened the paper and read as follows Please accept this outfit of clothes as the first instalment of a debt which I can never repay I have asked to have your wet suit dried when you can reclaim it Will you oblige me by calling to-morrow at my counting room No Pearl Street Your friend JAMES ROCKWELL CHAPTER XXVII CONCLUSION When Dick was dressed in his new suit he surveyed his figure with pardonable complacency It was the best he had ever worn and fitted him as well as if it had been made expressly for him Hes done the handsome thing said Dick to himself; but there wasnt no casion for his givin me these clothes My lucky stars are shinin pretty bright now Jumpin into the water pays better than shinin boots; but I dont think Id like to try it moren once a week About eleven oclock the next morning Dick repaired to Mr Rockwells counting-room on Pearl Street He found himself in front of a large and handsome warehouse The counting-room was on the lower floor Our hero entered and found Mr Rockwell sitting at a desk No sooner did that gentleman see him than he arose and advancing shook Dick by the hand in the most friendly manner My young friend he said you have done me so great service that I wish to be of some service to you in return Tell me about yourself and what plans or wishes you have formed for the future Dick frankly related his past history and told Mr Rockwell of his desire to get into a store or counting-room and of the failure of all his applications thus far The merchant listened attentively to Dicks statement and when he had finished placed a sheet of paper before him and handing him a pen said Will you write your name on this piece of paper? Dick wrote in a free bold hand the name Richard Hunter He had very much improved in his penmanship as has already been mentioned and now had no cause to be ashamed of it Mr Rockwell surveyed it approvingly How would you like to enter my counting-room as clerk Richard? he asked Dick was about to say Bully when he recollected himself and answered Very much I suppose you know something of arithmetic do you not? Yes sir Then you may consider yourself engaged at a salary of ten dollars a week You may come next Monday morning Ten dollars! repeated Dick thinking he must have misunderstood Yes; will that be sufficient? Its more than I can earn said Dick honestly Perhaps it is at first said Mr Rockwell smiling; but I am willing to pay you that I will besides advance you as fast as your progress will justify it Dick was so elated that he hardly restrained himself from some demonstration which would have astonished the merchant; but he exercised self-control and only said Ill try to serve you so faithfully sir that you wont repent having taken me into your service And I think you will succeed said Mr Rockwell encouragingly I will not detain you any longer for I have some important business to attend to I shall expect to see you on Monday morning Dick left the counting-room hardly knowing whether he stood on his head or his heels so overjoyed was he at the sudden change in his fortunes Ten dollars a week was to him a fortune and three times as much as he had expected to obtain at first Indeed he would have been glad only the day before to get a place at three dollars a week He reflected that with the stock of clothes which he had now on hand he could save up at least half of it and even then live better than he had been accustomed to do; so that his little fund in the savings bank instead of being diminished would be steadily increasing Then he was to be advanced if he deserved it It was indeed a bright prospect for a boy who only a year before could neither read nor write and depended for a nights lodging upon the chance hospitality of an alley-way or old wagon Dicks great ambition to grow up spectable seemed likely to be accomplished after all I wish Fosdick was as well off as I am he thought generously But he determined to help his less fortunate friend and assist him up the ladder as he advanced himself When Dick entered his room on Mott Street he discovered that some one else had been there before him and two articles of wearing apparel had disappeared By gracious! he exclaimed; somebodys stole my Washington coat and Napoleon pants Maybe its an agent of Barnums who expects to make a fortun by exhibitin the valooable wardrobe of a gentleman of fashion Dick did not shed many tears over his loss as in his present circumstances he never expected to have any further use for the well-worn garments It may be stated that he afterwards saw them adorning the figure of Micky Maguire; but whether that estimable young man stole them himself he never ascertained As to the loss Dick was rather pleased that it had occurred It seemed to cut him off from the old vagabond life which he hoped never to resume Henceforward he meant to press onward and rise as high as possible Although it was yet only noon Dick did not go out again with his brush He felt that it was time to retire from business He would leave his share of the public patronage to other boys less fortunate than himself That evening Dick and Fosdick had a long conversation Fosdick rejoiced heartily in his friends success and on his side had the pleasant news to communicate that his pay had been advanced to six dollars a week I think we can afford to leave Mott Street now he continued This house isnt as neat as it might be and I shall like to live in a nicer quarter of the city All right said Dick Well hunt up a new room to-morrow I shall have plenty of time having retired from business Ill try to get my reglar customers to take Johnny Nolan in my place That boy hasnt any enterprise He needs some body to look out for him You might give him your box and brush too Dick No said Dick; Ill give him some new ones but mine I want to keep to remind me of the hard times Ive had when I was an ignorant boot-black and never expected to be anything better When in short you were Ragged Dick You must drop that name and think of yourself now as Richard Hunter Esq said our hero smiling A young gentleman on the way to fame and fortune added Fosdick Here ends the story of Ragged Dick As Fosdick said he is Ragged Dick no longer He has taken a step upward and is determined to mount still higher There are fresh adventures in store for him and for others who have been introduced in these pages Those who have felt interested in his early life will find his history continued in a new volume

of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone For forty years he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the US unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility wwwgutenbergorg This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks
