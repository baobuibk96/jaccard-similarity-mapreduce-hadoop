I dont doubt it said Mrs Ladybug I should think shed be ashamed of herself And little Mrs Ladybug pursed up her lips and looked very severe And then she declared that she didnt see how people could say Betsy was even good-looking if they had ever noticed her tongue Honestly her tongues as long as she is! Mrs Ladybug gossiped But she knows enough to carry it curled up like a watch-spring so it isnt generally seen You just gaze at her closely some day when shes sipping nectar from a flower and youll see that I know what Im talking about Now some of those spiteful remarks may have reached Betsy Butterflys ears But she never paid the slightest attention to them When she met Mehitable Moth or Mrs Ladybug she always said How do you do? and Isnt this a _lovely_ day? in the sweetest tone you could imagine And of course there was nothing a body could do except to agree with Betsy Butterfly For it was bound to be a beautiful bright day or she wouldnt have been out So even those that didnt like Betsy had to give up trying to quarrel with her II JOHNNIE GREENS NET JOHNNIE GREEN was never quite happy unless he was collecting something One year he went about with a hammer chipping a piece off almost every rock in Pleasant Valley And of course he gathered birds eggs After he tired of that he began collecting postage stamps Next he turned his attention to tobacco tags even hailing travellers who passed the house to ask them whether they hadnt a hard one meaning by that a tag that was hard to get When he felt quite sure that he had a sample of every kind of tobacco tag in the whole world Johnnie Green had to think of something else to collect And since it was summer and a good time to find them he decided to start a collection of butterflies News spreads fast among the field people; and almost as soon as Johnnie Green had made up his mind about his new collection the whole Butterfly family knew of it Old Mr Crow was the one that first learned of Johnnies plan And he was not pleased either Butterflies! he scoffed I should think Johnnie Green might better spend his time doing something worth while Butterflies indeed! Now if he would only collect Crows thered be some sense in that! But that was before old Mr Crow and his neighbors understood exactly what a collection was And the Butterflies felt quite proud because Johnnie Green was going to busy himself with them Later when the field people discovered that collecting Butterflies meant catching them and sticking pins through their heads the Butterfly family became greatly excited and worried And as for old Mr Crow he was very glad that Johnnie had not decided to collect him and his relations Well if you had been in Pleasant Valley that summer on almost any fine day you might have seen Johnnie Green running about the fields or the flower garden with a butterfly net in his hand He had made the net from a barrel hoop and a piece of mosquito netting to which he nailed an old broomstick for a handle And for the first few days when he started making his new collection he didnt visit the swimming hole once When his father asked him to do a little work for him--such as feeding the chickens or leading the old horse Ebenezer to water--Johnnie Green was not so pleasant as he might have been He complained that he was too busy to bother with the farm chores just then But Farmer Green told him to run along and do his work Youll have plenty of time to play said Johnnies father The Butterfly family was sorry that Farmer Green didnt keep his boy at work from dawn till dark They didnt like to have to watch out for fear that horrid net might swoop down upon them and catch them They wanted to have a good time among the flowers without being in constant terror of capture at the hands of Johnnie Green But strange to say Betsy Butterfly was not in the least uneasy She was so gentle herself that she couldnt believe anybody would harm her Little did Betsy realize that she was really in great danger Her fatal beauty was sure to catch Johnnie Greens eye And though Betsy Butterfly did not know it only an accident could prevent her being added to Johnnie Greens collection III A MISHAP EXCEPT for the work that his father made him do now and then there was only one thing that bothered Johnnie Green in making his collection of butterflies The weather was not so good as it might have been He soon found that there was no use hunting for butterflies except in the sunshine So when a three days rain came Johnnie began to wish he had started a different sort of collection But the weather cleared at last And the sun came out so bright that Johnnie fairly pulled old Ebenezer away from the watering-trough and hustled him back to his stall; for he was in a hurry to get to the flower garden with his butterfly net As for the chickens they had very little food that day Once in the garden Johnnie Green found more butterflies than he had ever noticed before But as soon as he began chasing them they flew away to the meadow That is all but Betsy Butterfly She said she was sure Johnnie Green wouldnt annoy her And that was where she was wrong The moment he caught sight of her with her mottled red-and-brown wings with the violet tips Johnnie cried Theres a beauty! But Betsy Butterfly was so used to such remarks that she paid little heed to him Even when he crept nearer and nearer to her with old dog Spot at his heels she did not take fright With her tongue deep in a fragrant blossom she was enjoying its delicious sweetness when Johnnie Green bearing his net aloft sprang at her When Johnnie jumped Betsy Butterfly started up in alarm She had really waited until it was too late And if something unexpected hadnt happened to Johnnie Green Betsy would surely have had a place in his collection But luckily for her Johnnie met with a fall He may have tripped on a vine Or his foot may have slipped on the wet ground Anyhow he fell sprawling among the flowers dropping his precious net as he stretched out his hands to save himself Johnnies fall gave Betsy Butterfly her only chance Coiling her long tongue out of her way she quickly made her escape So Johnnie Green lost her But she was not all that he lost A strange accident happened just as he fell for old dog Spot leaped forward at the same time And much to his surprise Spot found his head inside the butterfly net The long broomstick handle thumped him sharply on his back And the silly fellow took fright at once With yelps of terror he scurried out of the flower garden And Johnnie picked himself up just in time to see Spot tearing across the meadow toward the woods Spot! Spot! Come back! Johnnie Green shouted But old Spot paid no attention to his young master Perhaps he was too scared to hear him Spot wanted to get rid of that net that covered his head And he knew of no better place to go than the woods where he hoped to be able to free himself from his odd muzzle by rubbing against a tree or nosing among some bushes Johnnie ran a little way after him But when he saw Spot duck into the woods he turned back sadly towards the house For all he knew old Spot might run a mile further before he stopped Johnnie would have to make a new net if he wanted to catch any more butterflies for his collection And the trouble was he had no more mosquito netting A good many of the field people saw old Spot as he dashed off with the butterfly net over his head And they enjoyed a hearty laugh at the strange sight As for Betsy Butterfly she had learned to watch out for Johnnie Green And she knew that another time he would have to be twice as spry as he had shown himself if he expected to capture her Old Spot didnt come home till afternoon When he appeared at last he looked very sheepish He hoped no one had noticed his fright And he wouldnt go near the flower garden again for a whole week IV BUSYBODIES LITTLE Mrs Ladybug said that she wished Betsy Butterfly no ill luck But she thought that perhaps it would have been a good thing for her if Johnnie Green had caught her and put her in his collection On hearing that strange remark Mehitable Moth turned quite pale She never wanted Johnnie Greens name mentioned by anyone because she lived in constant terror for fear he might mistake her for one of the Butterfly family and capture her What _do_ you mean? she asked Mrs Ladybug while fat Jennie Junebug waddled nearer them in order to hear everything they said Though Jennie was sleepy having stayed out very late the night before the promise of a bit of gossip made her brighten up at once I mean-- said Mrs Ladybug--I mean that Johnnie Green would certainly have brushed Betsy Butterfly before adding her to his collection And then seeing a blank look on the faces of her hearers she cried Dont tell me you havent noticed how untidy Betsy Butterfly is! Can it be possible that the airs she gives herself and her fine manners have deceived you? What is it? asked Mehitable Moth breathlessly And as for Jennie Junebug her breath was coming so fast that she couldnt say a word Ill tell you exactly what I mean Mrs Ladybug continued I stopped and spoke to Betsy Butterfly this very morning And I stepped up close to her because I wanted to see if she really does paint her wings as my friend Miss Moth here suspects Mrs Ladybug explained to Jennie Junebug And what do you think? I saw that Betsy Butterfly was _completely covered with dust_ from head to foot! Mehitable Moth looked rather uncomfortable She was somewhat dusty herself And she thought that Mrs Ladybug might be giving her a sly dig Perhaps Betsy had been on a journey she ventured Ah! But there is no dust to-day on account of the rain we had last night Mrs Ladybug replied Im convinced that the dust I saw on Betsy Butterfly was _weeks old_ The idea! Jennie Junebug exclaimed I should think shed be ashamed of herself Did you tell her how untidy she looked? Mrs Ladybug shook her head No! she answered But Ive been thinking the matter over And I believe its my duty to speak to her about it I dont see what shes thinking of to go about looking like that! Miss Moth looked more uneasy than ever especially when Mrs Ladybug said Wouldnt you like to come with me while I look for Betsy? I must go home now thank you! said Mehitable And she hurried away without another word But Jennie Junebug spoke up at once and said she would be delighted to accompany Mrs Ladybug Really Jennie confided to her companion its a good thing to have backs as hard and slippery as yours and mine For the dust cant stick to us as it does to some Theres no excuse for not keeping oneself neat Mrs Ladybug said severely And I shall give Betsy Butterfly a piece of my mind V NO JOKER MUCH to Mrs Ladybugs surprise she did not find Betsy Butterfly in the flower garden Its too bad shes not here Mrs Ladybug remarked to her friend Jennie Junebug who accompanied her Well have to look in the meadow And it may take a long time to find Betsy there Jennie Junebug yawned right in Mrs Ladybugs face Then I cant come with you she said Im getting terribly sleepy again And since I expect to be up all night Im going to take a nap Mrs Ladybug looked at Jennie with great disapproval as that fat young person crept under a leaf and went to sleep Things have come to a pretty pass when ladies stay out all night! she muttered It was not that way when I was a girl But times have changed for the worse The longer Mrs Ladybug stared at her sleeping friend the more she thought that she ought to wake her up If I rouse her shell be so drowsy to-night that shell simply have to go to bed Mrs Ladybug thought So she poked Jennie Junebug several times But Jennie Junebug only stirred slightly and murmured something in her sleep And seeing that it was useless to try to awaken her Mrs Ladybug set out for the meadow alone The sun hung low in the west when Mrs Ladybug found Betsy Butterfly among a clump of milk-weed blossoms But Mrs Ladybug did not care what time it was She was satisfied when she saw that Betsy was just as dusty as ever For to tell the truth little Mrs Ladybug was so jealous of the beautiful Betsy that she _wanted_ to say something disagreeable to her Hasnt this been a lovely day? Betsy Butterfly cried happily as soon as she noticed Mrs Ladybug Ive enjoyed every moment of it Ever since I saw you in the flower garden this morning Ive been here in the meadow flitting from one blossom to another You might better have spent a little of your time in a different way Mrs Ladybug remarked with a frown Betsy Butterfly looked up in surprise withdrawing her long tongue from the blossom in which she had just buried it _Ugh!_ A shudder shook prim Mrs Ladybug Please coil your tongue! she begged I cant bear the sight of it But I must say that I ought not to expect good manners in a person who goes about looking as untidy as you do Betsy Butterfly laughed gaily I didnt know you were such a joker! she exclaimed Oh Im not joking Mrs Ladybug said I mean every word I say Then I wouldnt talk so much if I were you Betsy Butterfly advised her with a merry twinkle in her eye And before Mrs Ladybug could say another word Betsy Butterfly flew away and left her spluttering and choking She insulted me! Mrs Ladybug screamed as soon as she was able to speak She insulted me And then she hurried off because she didnt dare stay! But Mrs Ladybug was mistaken about one thing Betsy Butterfly knew that she had just time to reach home before sunset So that was why she left so suddenly For she never was willing to travel when the sun was not shining Ill see Betsy in the morning Mrs Ladybug promised herself savagely Ill make it my business to follow her everywhere she goes until Ive given her a good talking to VI MRS LADYBUGS ADVICE LITTLE did Betsy Butterfly guess what Mrs Ladybug intended to say to her And if she had known what it was she would have been merely amused For Betsy was entirely too sweet-tempered to take offense at anybodys fault-finding--least of all that of Mrs Ladybug who was really a good-hearted soul when she wasnt jealous And when Betsy went to the flower garden early the next morning she felt kindly towards the whole world not even excepting Johnnie Green though he had tried to capture her Well Mrs Ladybug was waiting for Betsy Butterfly among the flowers She had been in such haste to reach the garden early that she had not stopped to have her breakfast And like many people who have not drunk their morning cup of coffee she was in a very peevish mood Now Miss Pert I want you to listen to me! That was Mrs Ladybugs greeting to Betsy Butterfly on one of the most delightful days of the whole summer Its my unpleasant duty-- said Mrs Ladybug who by that time was enjoying herself thoroughly--its my unpleasant duty to tell you that people are talking about you They say that youre going about _covered with dust_! And as a friend I advise you to give yourself a thorough brushing each morning and as often thereafter as may be necessary Betsy Butterfly had listened in amazement to Mrs Ladybugs words And she had hard work not to laugh too because she thought Mrs Ladybugs advice decidedly funny Thank you very much! Betsy said most politely Ill remember what youve told me Somehow Mrs Ladybug thought that Betsy meant she would follow her advice And she looked quite pleased I shall expect a great improvement in your appearance the next time I see you she announced And with the manner of a person who has just done somebody a good turn she hurried away to get the breakfast that was waiting for her somewhere Then Betsy Butterfly enjoyed a good laugh How ridiculous! she said to herself But I wont tell Mrs Ladybug of her mistake because she might feel upset if I did And you can see just by that how kind-hearted Betsy was She did not even tell her own family about the joke for fear of hurting Mrs Ladybugs feelings But jealous little Mrs Ladybug had no such misgivings _She_ went out of her way to explain to people that if they noticed a change in Betsy Butterflys appearance they might thank _her_ for it I told Betsy that she ought to brush the dust off herself she informed her friends Naturally she was displeased when she met Betsy that very afternoon and saw that the dust still lay thick on her wings I believe you actually want to be untidy! Mrs Ladybug cried And if you arent going to brush that dust off I shall do it myself! And grasping a small Indian paint-brush the weight of which she could scarcely stagger under Mrs Ladybug advanced upon Betsy Butterfly with a determined look in her eye Oh dont do that! cried Betsy Its my painful duty to give you a thorough dusting Mrs Ladybug declared VII BUTTERFLY BILL NOW a crowd had gathered quickly around Betsy Butterfly and Mrs Ladybug; for the field people are quick to notice anything unusual And a sprightly young cousin of Betsys known as Butterfly Bill said to Mrs Ladybug with a wink at everybody else I suppose youll dust the rest of us too? Only those that need it! replied Mrs Ladybug Then youll have your hands full Butterfly Bill told her Maybe you havent noticed that every member of the Butterfly family in Pleasant Valley is covered with dust just as Betsy is Mrs Ladybug looked surprised Is that so? she said faintly It certainly is! Bill cried Maybe you never knew that the dust is what gives us our--_ahem_--our beautiful colors he added proudly And I warn you that if you so much as touch my lovely cousin with that brush youll have every one of us fellows in your hair Of course poor Mrs Ladybug was quite bald But she knew what Butterfly Bill meant And she was so upset that she promptly let the paint-brush fall to the ground Then Betsys cousin nodded approvingly Now youd better hurry home he told Mrs Ladybug Theres a rumor around the meadow that your house is on fire And they say your children are in great danger Little Mrs Ladybug at once fell to weeping Its that horrid Freddie Firefly! she shrieked Ive told him to keep away from my home Ive told him that he would set it to blazing with that light of his But hes forever sneaking around my house as soon as my back is turned There there! Dont be frightened! Betsy Butterfly said to her soothingly Its only a rumor you know Thats so Mrs Ladybug admitted drying her eyes I hear it almost every day too But I never can get used to it I suppose this is only a false alarm after all I wouldnt be so sure about that Butterfly Bill said wickedly with a shake of his head And if I were you Id look after my own family a little more carefully instead of troubling myself with other peoples affairs Several of Bills friends applauded his speech But Betsy Butterfly whispered to him to hush Dont you see that Mrs Ladybug is not quite herself? she asked him But Butterfly Bill was not a person to be easily silenced like that Shes a meddling busybody! he declared And its my opinion that she ought to be put where shell have to mind her own business Who--me? called a wheezing voice right in his ear Turning Butterfly Bill saw that it was Jennie Junebug who had spoken to him She had noticed the crowd from a distance And she had just arrived quite out of breath Before Betsy Butterflys cousin Bill could answer Jennie Junebug actually threatened him If you were talking about me I shall have to knock you down she declared He had heard that Jennie delighted in flying _bang_ into anybody But he did not know that she indulged in that unladylike trick _only after dark_ Of course I didnt mean you! he said hastily And I hope you didnt mean my friend Mrs Ladybug either Jennie Junebug added For if you did---- But Butterfly Bill waited to hear no more Thoroughly frightened he sought safety in flight And as he flew away Mrs Ladybug couldnt help noticing the dust on his wings Theyre certainly a peculiar lot--that Butterfly family! she muttered VIII DO YOU LIKE BUTTER? AFTER Mrs Ladybug failed in her attempt to brush the dust off Betsy Butterfly she grew more jealous of Betsy than ever It was really a shame that Mrs Ladybug should feel like that Usually she was quite harmless even if she was a busybody and a gossip But she simply couldnt forgive Betsy Butterfly for being so beautiful And now Mrs Ladybug began to neglect her children more than ever in order to spy upon Betsy in the hope of discovering some new fault in her Betsy Butterfly soon noticed that wherever she went she was sure to see Mrs Ladybug who had a way of bobbing up in a most startling fashion But Betsy was always quite polite to the jealous little creature And she never failed to inquire for her health and that of her children as well even if she met Mrs Ladybug a dozen times a day For some reason Mrs Ladybug seemed quite touchy where her family was concerned You dont need to ask about my children she told Betsy at last in a somewhat sharp tone They are in the best of health And Ill let you know in case they fall ill Its strange she continued how everybody in this neighborhood is always prying into my household affairs Betsy Butterfly smiled to herself She did not care to quarrel with Mrs Ladybug--nor with anyone else for that matter So she abruptly changed the subject Do you like butter? she asked Why no! said Mrs Ladybug I dont care anything about it At least I never ate any Then I dont see how you know whether you like it or not Betsy observed unless youve looked into a buttercup to find out Mrs Ladybug was interested in spite of herself Can a person tell by doing that? she wanted to know Its a sure way said Betsy Butterfly I was just looking into this buttercup that Im sitting on when you flew up and spoke to me Do _you_ like butter? Mrs Ladybug inquired Im afraid not Betsy told her Id like to try myself Mrs Ladybug exclaimed eagerly But I dont know how Its simple enough Betsy Butterfly replied You just look into a buttercup blossom And if it makes your face yellow then youre fond of butter--whether you ever had any or not So Mrs Ladybug perched herself on a big blossom and peered earnestly into its cup Is my face yellow? she asked Betsy I do believe it is! Betsy Butterfly cried And Mrs Ladybug looked much pleased Ive always known I had refined tastes she remarked with a lofty air And now Id like to sample a bit of butter; but I dont know where to find any Butter? They make it at the farmhouse Betsy informed her Then perhaps Farmer Greens wife will let me have a little Mrs Ladybug said hopefully Ill go over to the farmhouse at once Its too bad you dont like butter too she added But secretly she was delighted that Betsy Butterfly had looked into a buttercup in vain IX UNEXPECTED NEWS LITTLE Mrs Ladybug had a disappointment when she reached the farmhouse She found to her dismay that she couldnt get inside it; for wire screens blocked her way through both doors and windows And nobody paid the slightest attention to her when she stopped at the buttery window and asked if she couldnt please have a bit of butter There was plenty of golden butter right there in plain sight since it happened to be churning day And Farmer Greens wife with her sleeves rolled above her elbows was working busily on the other side of the window screen I should think she might easily spare me a small sample! Mrs Ladybug cried at last Im afraid Farmer Greens wife is stingy Mrs Ladybug hoped that Johnnie Greens mother would hear her remark But she didnt And in the end Mrs Ladybug had to fly away with her longing for butter still unsatisfied Meanwhile Betsy Butterfly had been amusing herself in the meadow to her hearts content To tell the truth it was rather a relief to be rid of Mrs Ladybugs society for so long a time And Betsy hoped that Mrs Ladybugs errand to the farmhouse would keep that busybody engaged for the rest of the day Now after she left the farmhouse Mrs Ladybug set out to find Betsy Butterfly again But meeting Daddy Longlegs near the stone wall she stopped to gossip with him telling him how she had learned that she liked butter and explaining that she had not yet tasted any So you looked into a buttercup to find out eh? said Daddy Longlegs Ill have to do that myself Maybe Ive always liked butter too without knowing that I do You cant tell till you try Mrs Ladybug remarked But you mustnt be too sure You may be disappointed Theres Betsy Butterfly! She doesnt care for butter at all Are you sure about that? Daddy Longlegs inquired Really I think you must be mistaken for I saw her with her face just _buried_ in butter this very day At first Mrs Ladybug looked at him in amazement And then she grew very angry Betsy Butterfly deceived me! she cried in a shrill voice She was afraid that if I knew she ate butter she would have to share it with me Id like to know where she gets her butter Mrs Ladybug mused She was standing on some of Farmer Greens when I saw her Daddy Longlegs explained Did she ask him for it? Mrs Ladybug demanded I dont believe she did he admitted I think she just took it A wicked gleam came into Mrs Ladybugs eyes when she learned that And she threw up her hands exclaiming She steals! Betsy Butterfly steals butter! When the field people hear the news they wont think shes so fine And then Mrs Ladybug turned to Daddy Longlegs once more and demanded whether he knew of anything else that Betsy Butterfly was in the habit of taking from Farmer Green Eggs! he replied promptly Eggs! Mrs Ladybug repeated after him Betsy Butterfly steals butter and eggs! And before Daddy Longlegs could stop her she had hurried away to spread the news far and wide X THE NIGHT WATCH LITTLE Mrs Ladybug stopped everybody she met in the meadow and related how Betsy Butterfly was taking Farmer Greens butter--and his eggs too--without asking his permission Shes going to get some of us into trouble Mrs Ladybug informed her neighbors Just as likely as not Farmer Green and his wife will think others are stealing from them Why I went to the farmhouse to-day and asked for a bit of butter And what do you think? Mrs Green pretended not to hear me! I thought it was queer at the time But now I know that shes angry with me She must have missed some of her butter; and she thinks Im the guilty party Mrs Ladybug shook her finger at her neighbors Well have to do something to put a stop to Betsy Butterflys thieving she declared Jealous Mrs Ladybugs story amazed all the field people They could scarcely believe that anyone so beautiful and dainty as Betsy Butterfly would bemean herself by robbing Farmer Green--or anybody else But Mrs Ladybug said that Daddy Longlegs had _seen_ Betsy with her face buried in Farmer Greens butter And no one could doubt the word of so respectable a person as Daddy Longlegs What steps do you think we ought to take to prevent Betsy from eating any more butter and eggs that dont belong to her? asked the queen of the Bumblebee family I think we ought to set a careful watch on her said Mrs Ladybug Im sure I dont see when she gets her stolen goods because Ive watched her very closely myself for some time And Ive seen her dine on nothing but flowers Perhaps she goes to the farmhouse at night Jennie Junebug suggested Thats a happy thought! said Mrs Ladybug approvingly Well have to get Freddie Firefly to follow her about after dark So Mrs Ladybug and her neighbors made arrangements with Freddie Firefly to have Betsy Butterfly spied upon that very night Ill watch her till sunset Mrs Ladybug agreed And then _you_ must relieve me she told Freddie Dont let her out of your sight until sunrise! she warned him Freddie Firefly promised that he would be faithful to his trust And later that afternoon when the sun began to drop behind the mountains he relieved Mrs Ladybug who had been spying upon Betsy ever since their talk earlier in the day Shes behaved herself fairly well so far Mrs Ladybug whispered to Freddie as she prepared to fly home to her children But theres no knowing when she may start for the farmhouse So you mustnt take your eyes off her all night long! You can trust me Freddie assured her And then Mrs Ladybug said good evening * * * * * Freddie Firefly always claimed that that was the longest night he ever spent And he said that if he had realized that he would have to stay in one place from sunset to dawn he never would have agreed to watch Betsy Butterfly For Betsy Butterfly went to sleep the moment the sun went down Freddie had to remain for hours and hours where he could flash his light upon her And all the while he knew that his whole family was having a delightful time dancing in the hollow over towards the swamp It was especially hard for Freddie because he could see the gay lights of the Fireflies twinkling through the dark But Betsy Butterfly knew nothing of his long vigil She slept and slept the whole night long And Freddie Firefly had to admit to himself as he watched her that she didnt _act_ like a robber in the least XI A SLY ONE WHEN Freddie Firefly reported to Mrs Ladybug and her neighbors that Betsy Butterfly had taken neither butter nor eggs from Farmer Green during the night the field people were much puzzled Shes certainly a sly one! Mrs Ladybug exclaimed What do you think we ought to do now? she asked Daddy Longlegs who was supposed to be very old and therefore very wise I think you ought to warn her he replied after some thought You ought to tell Betsy Butterfly that she must stop pilfering No doubt your advice is good Mrs Ladybug observed And Ill speak to Betsy this very morning You must come with me she told Daddy I naturally want to have a witness Oh Ill come! he cried in his thin quavering voice though what she meant by a witness was more than he knew So Mrs Ladybug and Daddy Longlegs set forth to find Betsy Butterfly And behind them followed a crowd of their neighbors Even lazy Buster Bumblebee joined the procession Though he was a drone and never worked he was always ready to exert himself for the sake of any new excitement The strange company wandered back and forth across the meadow for some time without finding Betsy Butterfly But at last Mrs Ladybug spied her And soon Betsy found herself surrounded by the mob Goodness! she cried looking about her in surprise How nice of you all to call on me! Im _so_ glad to see you! Betsy Butterfly was so cordial that Mrs Ladybug couldnt help looking somewhat uncomfortable She couldnt avoid a strange feeling of guilt And yet she told herself that Betsy Butterfly was really the guilty one Shes a bold piece! Mrs Ladybug exclaimed under her breath Perhaps you wont be so happy to see us when you hear what we have to say to you Mrs Ladybug began There hasnt been an accident I hope! Betsy cried Your house hasnt burned? No! replied Mrs Ladybug And again she said No! in a very decided manner Weve come to warn you that weve found out about your trickery she announced We know that you like butter and that youre in the habit of taking it from Farmer Green--yes! and eggs too! Why I dont know what youre talking about! Betsy Butterfly faltered She was really greatly surprised It wont help you to be untruthful Mrs Ladybug told her severely Its no wonder-- she added--its no wonder Mrs Green wouldnt give me a bit of butter when I went to the farmhouse yesterday She thought _I_ was the one thats been stealing it from her right along And then Mrs Ladybug was amazed by what followed For Betsy Butterfly actually smiled at her Youre mistaken she said I never eat butter I dont like it And as for eggs how could I ever break through an egg-shell? I dont know anything about that said Mrs Ladybug And besides I didnt come here to be questioned she added tartly If you have any questions to ask just ask em of _him_ for hes seen you with your face buried in butter! And she pointed at Daddy Longlegs And now it was _his_ turn to look uncomfortable For he considered Betsy Butterfly to be very beautiful indeed XII A TERRIBLE BLUNDER WHEN the beautiful Betsy Butterfly turned her gaze on him Daddy Longlegs couldnt help wishing that he had worn his new coat that day However he straightened his necktie carefully and tried to look as well as he could So youve seen me eating butter have you? Betsy Butterfly asked him Not _eating_ it! he corrected her Ive seen you _standing_ on it And your face was hidden in it too Mrs Ladybug shot a triumphant glance at the crowd of which she and Betsy Butterfly and Daddy Longlegs were the center What have you to say now my fine lady? she demanded of Betsy with a sneer And still Betsy Butterfly was quite unruffled Where did you see me doing that? she asked Daddy Longlegs pleasantly enough I object! Mrs Ladybug interrupted hastily You neednt answer her question she advised Daddy Longlegs I know her tricks! Shell keep us talking here until we forget what our errand was! But Daddy Longlegs paid no attention to Mrs Ladybugs advice I saw you in this meadow he explained And Mrs Ladybug began to look somewhat worried Come! she cried Lets all go home now Weve warned her; and well leave her to think over what shes done I hope-- Mrs Ladybug added turning to Betsy Butterfly--I hope youll decide to turn over a new leaf Why thats exactly what she did that time when I saw her! Daddy Longlegs shouted While I was watching her I saw her turn over a leaf So whats the use of her turning over another And now it was Mrs Ladybugs turn to look amazed and bewildered I dont know what youre talking about she snapped glaring at Daddy Longlegs And I dont believe you know yourself Oh! yes I do! he retorted shrilly Butter has no leaves said Mrs Ladybug with a knowing air I saw heaps and heaps of it in Farmer Greens buttery yesterday And there wasnt a leaf on it How about eggs then? shouted somebody in the crowd It was stupid Buster Bumblebee! And of course nobody paid any heed to his silly question As he stared at Mrs Ladybug dully Daddy Longlegs let his mouth fall wide open Why what do you mean? he demanded at last You and I arent talking about the same sort of butter at all! Youre describing the kind of butter that Mrs Green makes at the farmhouse And what pray tell have you been talking about all this time? Mrs Ladybug gasped The butter-and-eggs in the meadow! Daddy Longlegs informed her I suppose you know the plant dont you? Ive heard of it Mrs Ladybug replied But I doubt if there is such a thing And I say there is! Buster Bumblebee clamored We Bumblebees are very fond of butter-and-eggs And were about the only field people that know how to open a blossom and reach its nectar Little Mrs Ladybug waited to hear no more Youve made a terrible blunder! she told Daddy Longlegs hurriedly And before he could answer her she had hastened away Like many another jealous body Mrs Ladybug had behaved very foolishly And it was no wonder that she wanted to get away from the crowd She didnt even beg Betsy Butterflys pardon for calling her a thief But all the rest of the field people realized at last that Betsy was no thief The butter-and-eggs plant they were well aware was as free as the clover or the milk-weed blossoms or any other of the wild flowers Everybody knew that Farmer Green laid no claim to them though they did grow in his meadow And when Betsy Butterfly thanked Daddy Longlegs for his explanation he wished more than ever that he had worn his new coat that day--and his new hat too XIII THE FRIENDLY STRANGER OF course anyone so beautiful as Betsy Butterfly was bound to attract attention Wherever she went people turned their heads--if they could--to look at her And those whose heads were so fastened to their bodies that they simply couldnt crane their necks at anybody--even those unlucky creatures wheeled themselves about in order to gaze at Betsy If they happened to be ladies they stared at her because they wanted to see what was the latest style in gowns or maybe hats And if they happened to be gentlemen they looked at her because they just couldnt help it It was no wonder then that Betsy Butterfly had many admirers In fact she was so accustomed to their flittering after her that usually she paid little heed to them But now and then one of them made himself so agreeable that Betsy favored him slightly more than the others Such was a stranger dressed in yellowish brown whom she chanced to meet among the flowers one day He was flying from flower to flower with a loud buzzing And he reminded Betsy Butterfly of somebody but she couldnt just think who it was Ah! said the stranger as soon as he caught Betsys eye The blossoms are fine and fresh after last nights shower arent they? Betsy had to admit that what the stranger said was true And when he came right over to the flower where she was breakfasting and began buzzing around her and eating pollen Betsy Butterfly thought that for a stranger he seemed very friendly She looked at him for a time out of the corner of her eye while she tried to recall whom the newcomer resembled But he looked like no one she had even seen And then all at once Betsy knew what was so familiar about him It was his voice! You remind me of a friend of mine she remarked He lives in the meadow not far from here Its your buzzing she explained If I didnt see you I should think you were Buster Bumblebee Betsys remark seemed to please the stranger And he smiled smugly while he buzzed louder than ever Its not surprising that I make you think of him he observed Indeed it would be odd if I didnt for Im a sort of cousin of Busters so to speak Perhaps you didnt know that my name is Bumble--Joseph Bumble Naturally Betsy and Joseph became good friends on the spot And after that people often saw them rambling together among the flowers Now Joseph Bumble proved to be a great talker And since Betsy Butterfly was an excellent listener they spent many agreeable hours together At least Joseph enjoyed every minute that he spent in Betsy Butterflys company And if at times she found his prattle a bit tiresome she was too well-mannered to say so If the truth were known Joseph Bumble proved to be somewhat of a braggart He was forever boasting of his connection with the Bumblebee family And Betsy couldnt say anything to him without his remarking that his cousin Buster Bumblebees mother the well-known Queen thought this or that And being of royal blood the Queen ought to know whats what he frequently said I suppose-- Betsy said to him at last--I suppose youre of royal blood yourself Mr Bumble? Oh very! he replied with a smirk Were all of us very royal indeed And Betsy Butterfly thought how pleasant it was to be friends with anyone who came from such a fine family as Joseph Bumbles XIV A DEEP PLOT AS time passed Betsy continued to see a great deal of Joseph Bumble And she noticed one peculiar thing Although he talked continually of his cousin Buster Bumblebee the Queens son no one had ever seen the two together How does it happen she asked Joseph at last that I never find you with your cousin? Arent you friends? Were certainly not _enemies_ said Joseph Bumble though I must admit that were not quite so intimate as we might be You see Buster and I have different tastes And now that the red clover is in blossom he spends all his time in the clover field But as you know like you I am very fond of flowers And Id far rather be here in the meadow--or the flower garden--with you than in the clover patch with Buster Bumblebee Naturally such an answer was bound to please Betsy Butterfly And after that she bothered her head no more about the friendship between the two cousins Certainly Joseph Bumbles explanation sounded reasonable And she had no cause to doubt his statement Meanwhile there were others among Betsy Butterflys admirers who became very peevish on observing how much time Betsy and the newcomer in the neighborhood Joseph Bumble were spending in each others society And they agreed among themselves that something ought to be done to put an end to the upstart Bumbles boasting Betsy Butterfly thinks the fellow is a cousin of Buster Bumblebees said Chirpy Cricket But Ive noticed that he and Buster are never together Lets ask Buster to come over to the meadow so that he may meet this cousin of his! And then perhaps well learn something more about Joseph Bumble than we know now Everybody said that that was a good plan And Betsys admirers chose Daddy Longlegs to call on Buster Bumblebee and invite him to a party to be given in the meadow the following day Daddy Longlegs agreed to do the errand in spite of the fact that for him it was half a days journey to the Bumblebees home from the stone wall where he lived But he thought that by hurrying he ought to be able to get back in time to put on his best coat and go to the party though he might arrive somewhat late Dont forget to ask Betsy Butterfly to the party! Daddy called as he started off on his long trip Dont worry! Ill attend to that myself Chirpy Cricket promised And dont forget to invite Joseph Bumble! Daddy cautioned him Oh! we dont need to ask him said Chirpy Cricket _Hell_ come without being invited unless Im greatly mistaken * * * * * Luckily for Daddy Longlegs there was not a breath of wind either that day or the following one So he made excellent time to the Bumblebee home where he found Buster Bumblebee and gave him his invitation Then Daddy turned around and started back towards his stone wall Buster Bumblebee had promised to come to the party And Daddy wanted to be present when the two cousins Buster Bumblebee and Joseph Bumble met--with Betsy Butterfly right there to watch them XV JOSEPH BUMBLES COMPLAINT IT happened just as Chirpy Cricket had expected Betsy Butterfly arrived at the party with her admirer Joseph Bumble buzzing close behind her Although he had not been invited he did not feel the least bit shy about coming Being of a royal family I never wait to be asked to a place he had explained loftily to Betsy And youll see that everybody will be glad to see me at the party People always consider it an honor to have me at their entertainments Josephs words proved partly true anyhow Anyone could see that Joseph Bumble was more than welcome Chirpy Cricket and Daddy Longlegs--as well good many others--rushed up to him and told him how pleased they were to see him And Joseph Bumble was having a very agreeable time talking in a loud voice about himself and his family when he suddenly stopped short A look of displeasure crossed his face And Daddy Longlegs asked him if he had eaten something that disagreed with him No! replied Joseph Bumble Ive been interrupted And its hardly the sort of treatment a person of royal blood--like myself--expects to receive at a party Who interrupted you? Chirpy Cricket inquired I dont know Joseph Bumble answered But someone was talking in a loud voice Are you sure it wasnt yourself that you heard? Daddy Longlegs wanted to know Certainly not! cried Joseph Dont be silly! Dont you suppose I know my own voice when I hear it? Perhaps it was your echo that you heard Daddy ventured At that Joseph Bumble rudely turned his back on him and began whispering to Chirpy Cricket He was actually suggesting that Daddy Longlegs should be thrown out of the party! And then Mr Bumble again paused abruptly and listened There! he said to Chirpy Cricket Dont you hear that buzzing? Thats the person that interrupted me And Id like to have him put out of the party too along with this queer old chap who insulted me a moment ago Chirpy Cricket looked around until his eye rested on Buster Bumblebee who had just arrived and who was at that moment talking with Betsy Butterfly Theres the young man you hear! Chirpy told Joseph Bumble Dont you know him? No! replied Joseph as his eyes followed Chirpy Crickets And I dont want to know him either He looks to me to be a very ordinary person And anybody can see that hes annoying Betsy Butterfly I tell you I want him chased away from here at once For Im of royal blood; and Im not accustomed to go to parties with ragtags and bobtails Im a cousin of Buster Bumblebee the Queens son Well Chirpy Cricket tried hard not to laugh right in Joseph Bumbles face Ill see what I can do Chirpy promised him And I will admit that _somebody_ ought to be barred out of this party Good! exclaimed Joseph Bumble Im glad to know that youre so sensible Perhaps he would have spoken in a different fashion had he known exactly what Chirpy Cricket had in mind But now he said nothing more though he continued to stare angrily at Buster Bumblebee who was glad to see Betsy Butterfly and was telling her as much too XVI NOTHING BUT A FRAUD AT last Joseph Bumbles displeasure passed all control He began to buzz as loud as he could hoping to drown Buster Bumblebees buzzing so that Buster could no longer talk to Betsy Butterfly Naturally Buster soon had to raise his own voice in order to make himself heard And soon the two made such a roar that everybody else had to stop up his ears Noticing a look of distress on Betsy Butterflys face Buster asked her what the trouble was You and your cousin Joseph are making a terrible racket she told him My cousin Joseph! cried Buster Bumblebee And who is he I should like to know? Point him out to me please! For I didnt know I had a cousin at this party There he is! said Betsy Butterfly nodding her head towards the glowering Joseph What! That unshaven stranger in the yellowish-brown suit? cried Buster Bumblebee I assure you hes no relation of mine You must be mistaken Betsy persisted He says hes your cousin and of royal blood himself Nonsense! cried Buster Bumblebee Just let me talk to him a moment and Ill soon prove that your friend is nothing but a fraud Accordingly Buster left her and straightway perched himself upon a daisy directly in front of Joseph Bumble How-dy do! said Buster I hear youve been talking about me Now Joseph Bumbles only thought was that the noisy chap in the yellow and black velvet must have overheard what he had said to Chirpy Cricket about throwing him out of the party I dont care to talk with you Joseph announced in his grandest manner Im from such a fine family that I have to be very particular about whom Im seen with Is that so? said Buster I suppose if Buster Bumblebee were at this party youd be glad to talk with him? I should say I would! was the others answer Hes my cousin Whats your name anyhow? Buster Inquired Joseph Bumble! Whats the rest of it? Buster Bumblebee demanded while the whole company surged around him so that they might hear I refuse to answer! said Joseph Bumble And afterward Daddy Longlegs declared that at that moment he saw the fellows knees trembling Come! said Joseph Bumble turning suddenly to Betsy Butterfly I see that weve accidentally fallen in with some rough people; and wed better be moving on But Betsy Butterfly didnt even look at Joseph What _is_ his full name? she asked Buster Hes a Bumble Flower-Beetle Buster said And as for his being related to me thats all humbug This stranger is no kin either to the Bumblebee or any other Bee family But his voice is so much like ours that hes taken part of our name though our family has always claimed that he has no right to it Who are you? Joseph Bumble demanded of Buster quite fiercely He was determined to put his enemy to rout if he could Im Buster Bumblebee! was the reply Dont you know your cousin? When he heard that Joseph Bumble knew at once that the game was up His trickery was discovered beyond a doubt So with one last lingering look at the beautiful Betsy he took to his wings And no one ever saw him in those parts again As for Betsy Butterfly she never could bear after that to hear the name of Joseph Bumble so much as mentioned XVII DUSTYS DIFFICULTY IT was to be expected that as time went on Betsy Butterflys fame would spread far and wide And long before the summer was over half the creatures that lived in Pleasant Valley knew her They were the ones that went about by daylight and rested at night As for the other half--the night-prowlers--many of them had heard about the beautiful Betsy though of course they had never seen her That is none of them had set eyes on her except Freddie Firefly who had flashed his light upon Betsy all one night because Mrs Ladybug had a strange notion that she was stealing butter from the farmhouse In fact after that happened Freddie Firefly had gone about telling all his friends how beautiful Betsy Butterfly was and saying what a pity it was that she didnt like moonlight as well as sunshine He talked so much about her that at last a good many of the night-prowling people said that they wished they might see Betsy Butterfly just once for they could scarcely believe that anybody could be as dainty and bewitching as Freddie Firefly would have them believe her And there was one dashing young chap of the Moth family who became especially eager to make Betsys acquaintance Indeed he began to complain that he was losing his appetite through thinking about Betsy Butterfly So he besought Freddie Firefly to help him out of his difficulty Now while he was talking with Freddie Firefly this young Moth who was known as Dusty never once stopped eating Freddie Firefly noticed how his fat sides stuck out And he wondered what the fellows appetite could have been like before he lost some of it You dont act like one in delicate health Freddie Firefly observed as he watched the greedy Dusty consume more food Oh but I am! Dusty Moth protested feebly Im so weak now that I can hardly raise myself with my wings Freddie was sure that Dustys trouble was merely due to his being too fat But he saw no reason for quarreling with him Cant you think of some plan by which I could meet Betsy Butterfly? Dusty Moth persisted Perhaps if I could see her just once Id be able to get my mind _off_ her--and _on_ my meals again I dont know how I can help you Freddie Firefly confessed You see Betsy goes home exactly at sunset And at present she never seems to make her home in the same place for even two nights So one can never be sure where she will be Of course when the sun is shining you can always find her among the flowers But that wont help you any because youre such a sleepy-head in the daytime that you couldnt see anything even if it was stuck right into your eyes Cant you explain my sad case to Betsy Butterfly? Dusty Moth asked hopefully Ive heard that shes very kind-hearted And if she knew how Im suffering on her account Im sure shed be glad to meet me some pleasant dark night He begged so piteously that in the end Freddie Firefly agreed to do what he could But I warn you-- he said--I warn you that I cant give you much hope XVIII SOLOMON OWLS IDEA FREDDIE FIREFLY actually did send a message to Betsy Butterfly telling her that Dusty Moth wanted to see her and saying that unless she would agree to meet him in the meadow some night soon Dusty was afraid he would lose his appetite entirely But Betsy thought the whole affair was only a joke So she merely laughed--and sent Freddie no answer at all; for she hardly believed that she needed to explain to him that nothing could induce her to stir out after sunset Freddie Firefly was much upset because he received no answer to his message Perhaps he would not have cared so much had Dusty Moth not made his life miserable each night from dusk to dawn But that persistent fellow kept asking Freddie every few minutes if he had heard from her yet And naturally anyone would grow tired if he had to keep saying No! no! no! all night long At the same time Dusty Moth kept insisting in a most annoying way that if he lost much more of his appetite he would be ill and it would be Freddie Fireflys fault So Freddie Firefly began to worry He came finally to detest Dusty Moth And Freddies family noticed that he was growing quite thin because Dusty Moth left him little time--between questions--in which to eat his meals comfortably I declare I wish Betsy Butterfly would move away from Pleasant Valley! Freddie Firefly exclaimed at last quite out of patience with everybody and everything Im in a pretty fix I am! And since I dont know how to get rid of this annoying Dusty Moth Im going to ask Solomon Owl what Id better do That at least was a comforting thought So the following morning just before dawn he made what might be termed a flying call on Solomon Owl who lived in the hemlock woods beyond the swamp And luckily wise old Solomon thought of a good plan at once As soon as he had heard Freddie Fireflys story he said to him If Betsy Butterfly refuses to meet your friend why dont you ask her for her picture? Thats a splendid idea! Freddie cried How in the world did you ever happen to think of it Mr Owl? Solomon Owl hooted at that question Thats my secret he said If I told all I know everybody else would be just as wise as I am And after giving another long string of hoots which he followed with a burst of loud laughter Solomon Owl popped into his house Anyhow Freddie Firefly couldnt complain for he now had a remedy for his trouble And he felt so carefree and happy again that on his way across the meadow he stopped to talk with Jimmy Rabbit who was taking a stroll in the direction of Farmer Greens cabbage patch Freddie Firefly quickly told Jimmy all about his affair with Dusty Moth He even explained how he had gone to ask Solomon Owls help and related what that wise bird had advised Theres only one thing that worries me now said Freddie Firefly anxiously Im wondering whether Betsy Butterfly has ever had a picture made of herself XIX A BIT OF LUCK JIMMY RABBIT promptly set Freddie Fireflys fears at rest I happen to know said he that Betsy Butterfly has a picture of herself Are you sure? Freddie asked him eagerly I ought to be replied Jimmy Rabbit because I painted it myself the very next day after I finished a portrait of old Mr Crow It ought to be a good one if you made it said Freddie But wasnt it some time ago that you were an artist? It was earlier in the summer Jimmy Rabbit admitted Of course Betsy Butterfly has changed somewhat since then But this picture was a fine likeness of her at the time I painted it I suppose he added I was the first one in the whole valley to perceive that she was going to be a beauty when she got her full growth Do you suppose shell send me the picture if I ask her so I can show it to Dusty Moth? Freddie asked Jimmy Rabbit looked a bit doubtful He pondered for a few moments And then he said Ill tell you what Ill do! To-morrow morning Ill see Betsy and Ive no doubt that shell loan me the picture if I promise to return it to her Thatll be great! cried Freddie Meet me near the duck pond as soon as its dark to-morrow night; and be sure to bring Betsys picture with you! Then Freddie Firefly hurried off to find Dusty Moth who happened likewise to be looking for him because he had a question to ask They met shortly And Dusty Moth immediately cried Have you heard from her?--meaning Betsy Butterfly of course Now see here! Freddie Firefly said Its plain enough that Betsy doesnt care to meet you But I have a plan that ought to suit you well enough If you could look at her picture once youd be satisfied wouldnt you? I would-- replied Dusty Moth--if I got my appetite back afterward Well will you promise to stop pestering me about Betsy Butterfly if I let you see this picture of her? Yes! yes! Dusty promised impatiently Where is it? Quick! Let me see it! Oh! Youll have to wait till to-morrow night Freddie explained I shall not be able to eat a single mouthful till then! Dusty Moth groaned Well--you can suit yourself about that Freddie told him impatiently And please dont speak to me again to-night! Ive been troubled enough on your account without being bothered by you any more One moment! cried Dusty as Freddie Firefly started to leave him Well--what do you want now? Freddie growled flashing his light impatiently in Dusty Moths eyes Are you sure she will let you take the picture? Dusty asked him Yes! yes! Of course she will! Why shouldnt she I should like to know? You certainly do ask the silliest questions! And yet Freddie Firefly had put the same query himself to Jimmy Rabbit only a short time before But now he was quite certain that his worries were almost at an end Betsy Butterfly has caused me a powerful lot of trouble! Freddie grumbled as he hurried over the hollow to join in the dance of the Firefly family XX SOMETHING SEEMS WRONG WHEN Jimmy Rabbit went to see Betsy Butterfly the next morning he found her quite willing to let him take her picture away with him But I must say-- Betsy remarked--I must say that I dont understand why anybody should want to borrow this old portrait Everyone tells me I have changed a great deal since you made it Thats true Jimmy Rabbit agreed But the person to whom Im going to show it wont know the difference I dont believe he knows me then she remarked No! And probably he never will said Jimmy Rabbit But dont you worry about that! From what I hear of him hes a good deal of a bore Dont bother to bring back that picture! she called to Jimmy Rabbit as he hopped away Im afraid Betsy Butterfly is growing vain he murmured to himself To be sure she _has_ changed But I shall always like this portrait of her because I painted it myself Later when he was in Farmer Greens garden he wrapped the picture carefully in a rhubarb leaf and hid it beneath a pile of brush And he didnt come back for it until after dark just as the moon peeped above the rim of the hills At the duck pond Jimmy Rabbit found Freddie Firefly waiting for him hopping up and down and flashing his light through the misty gloom Did you get it? Freddie demanded Its safe in my pocket Jimmy assured him Let me have it! said Freddie Dusty Moth is waiting for me at the fence-corner near the orchard And I want to give him a good look at Betsy Butterflys picture before the moon gets too high for he cant see well if theres too much light Jimmy Rabbit drew the picture carefully from his pocket And Freddie Firefly took it and slung it across his back He fairly staggered under the weight Arent you going to look at Betsys picture yourself? Jimmy Rabbit asked him Its a good bit of work if I do say so Oh! I dont care about seeing it Its nothing to me you know said Freddie carelessly But I hope Dusty Moth will be satisfied with it Well I wont go with you to see if he is Jimmy Rabbit told him I usually have a light lunch at this hour So Ill meet you here at the duck pond after I come back from the cabbage patch They parted then And shortly afterward Freddie Firefly dropped down beside Dusty Moth who made no attempt to conceal his pleasure At last! he cried At last I am to behold the beautiful Betsy Butterflys picture! I do hope its a good likeness! he added as he began with trembling hands to unwrap the rhubarb covering from the portrait It certainly is Freddie Firefly assured him It was made by a friend of mine who once painted a famous picture of old Mr Crow While Freddie danced along the top of the fence Dusty Moth carried the picture into the shade of an apple tree out of the moonlight so that he might see it more clearly A few moments later Freddie Firefly was both surprised and alarmed to hear a cry of anguish from the direction of the apple tree Whats the matter? he called Theres nothing wrong I hope? But Dusty Moth made no reply XXI A STRANGE CHANGE RECEIVING no answer to his question Freddie Firefly skipped down from the fence and sought the shade of the apple tree where he found Dusty Moth staring fixedly at Betsy Butterflys picture Dustys face wore a most curious look; he seemed at once angry sorrowful and amazed And not till Freddie Firefly asked again what _was_ the trouble did Dusty Moth say a word Then he pointed scornfully toward the portrait that Jimmy Rabbit had made earlier in the summer So thats the charming Betsy Butterfly eh? he roared Thats the beauty Ive heard so much about! I can tell you right now that if I had any idea she looked like this I never would have lost my appetite over her! You astonish me! Freddie Firefly exclaimed Have you forgotten how anxious you were to meet the lady? Meet her! Dusty Moth howled I promise you Id never go out of my way to meet anybody that looked as she does--though I might go a long distance to avoid her Freddie Firefly glanced toward the picture But it had fallen face downward upon the ground And he did not take the trouble to raise it Well you think Betsy Butterfly is beautiful dont you? he asked Indeed I dont! I think shes hideous Dusty Moth shouted Never in all my life have I been so deceived in a person I dont understand how you can say that Freddie Firefly told him But I suppose your idea of beauty may be different from mine--and from many other peoples too Anyhow I hope youll get your appetite back again I dont know about that said Dusty Moth Just now I dont feel as if I ever wanted to taste food again A shudder passed over him And he covered his eyes as if to shut some terrible image from his memory I must leave you now said Freddie Firefly And please dont forget what you promised me You remember that you said that if Id show you a picture of Betsy Butterfly you would stop pestering me about her Dont worry about that! Dusty Moth assured him bitterly I shall never mention Betsy Butterflys name again I dont want to think of her But Im afraid I can never never get her face out of my mind I know-- he added--I know I shall see it in my dreams And just think how terrible it will be to wake at midday out of a sound sleep with her dreadful face and form haunting me! Freddie Firefly couldnt help feeling sorry for the poor chap But he could think of nothing to do except to show him Betsys portrait once more So he started to raise the picture from the ground where it still lay face downward And the moment Dusty Moth saw what he was about he gave a frightful scream--and flew off into the night Hes a queer one! Freddie Firefly mused Now Ive always thought Betsy was a fine-looking---- Just then his eyes fell upon the picture for the first time And Freddie Fireflys mouth fell open in astonishment So amazed was he by what he saw that he tumbled right over backwards And then scrambling to his feet he wrapped the rhubarb leaf hastily around the picture and slung it across his back again Jimmy Rabbit has made a terrible mistake! he groaned as he started for the duck pond * * * * * Back at the meeting place once more Freddie Firefly rushed up to Jimmy Rabbit in great excitement Do you know what you did? he cried You brought me the wrong picture And Dusty Moth has gone shrieking off into the darkness he was so disappointed This is not Betsy Butterflys picture! Its some dreadful-looking caterpillar And when I glanced at it just now over in the orchard it sent a chill all through me For the time being Jimmy Rabbit said nothing At first he had seemed quite upset But before Freddie had finished speaking he had begun to smile And then he unwrapped the picture once more and leaned it against a stone where the moons rays fell squarely upon it Youre mistaken he informed Freddie then This _is_ a picture of Betsy Butterfly I painted it myself; and I ought to know As I explained last night I made it earlier in the summer; and as I said she has changed somewhat in the meantime But its a very good likeness of her as she was once You mean-- gasped Freddie Firefly--you mean that Betsy Butterfly was once an ugly caterpillar? Why certainly! said Jimmy Rabbit And so was Dusty Moth for that matter Yes! he was a caterpillar himself once--and a much uglier one than Betsy if only he knew it In fact said Jimmy looking at the picture with his head on one side as caterpillars go Betsy Butterfly was a great beauty even at so early an age XXII THE SKIPPER IN Farmer Greens meadow there lived a very nervous person called the Skipper He was a distant cousin of Betsy Butterflys And since the two were almost exactly the same age they quite naturally spent a good deal of time together The Skipper was of a dark somber brown shade And it always seemed to the gaily colored Betsy that he tried to make up for his dull appearance by being extremely lively in his movements He was forever skipping suddenly from one place to another--a trick which had caused people to call him by so odd a name Much as she liked this queer cousin Betsy often found his uncertain habit somewhat annoying It was not very pleasant when talking to him to discover that he had unexpectedly left her when she supposed he was right beside her or behind her If she had anything important to tell him she frequently had to hurry after him And the worst of it was once she had overtaken him she never knew when he would dart away again As the summer lengthened it seemed to Betsy Butterfly that the Skipper grew more flighty than ever Once she had been able to say a few words to him before he went swooping off But now--now she could not even tell him that it was a nice day without following her cousin at least half an hour in order to finish her remark Youre becoming terribly fidgety Betsy told him at last If you dont look out youll have nervous prostration--or I shall if you dont stop jumping about like a jack-in-the-box I advise you she said to see a doctor before you get any worse Of course it must not be supposed that Betsy Butterfly could say all that to her cousin without going to a good deal of trouble As a matter of fact she had to follow him about the fields for two whole days and travel several miles before she succeeded in finishing what she wanted to say to him Why I feel fine! the Skipper cried I dont need a doctor I---- He started to skip away from the wild morning-glory blossom on which he had perched himself But Betsy caught him just in time--and held him Now you listen to me! she commanded Youre in a dangerous condition Some day someone will come to you with an important message And if you go sailing off the way you do hows he ever going to tell the whole message until its too late perhaps? If it was good news it wouldnt hurt it to keep it a while the Skipper asserted cheerfully And he gave a quick spring with the hope of escaping from Betsys grasp But she held him firmly by the coat-tails Suppose I wanted to warn you not to go near the flower garden because Johnnie Green was waiting there for you with his net to capture you and put you in his collection? You might be sorry afterwards if you didnt sit still and listen to me Thats so! said the Skipper I hadnt thought of that Id see a doctor at once; but I dont know any Go to Aunt Polly Woodchuck under the hill Betsy Butterfly advised him Shes the best doctor for miles around So they went together to call on Aunt Polly The old lady looked at the Skipper and shook her head I cant help him she said Betsy asked anxiously Is his trouble catching? No indeed! said Aunt Polly He cant stay in one place long enough to give it to anybody Well after that Betsy saw very little of her cousin the Skipper But she did not mind that especially since she soon made the acquaintance of a very agreeable young gentleman who dressed in the height of fashion He wore a swallowtail coat every day And the neighbors all said that his manners were delightful _He_ never went skipping off while Betsy Butterfly was talking to him THE END * * * * * Illustration The HONEY BUNCH BOOKS _by_ HELEN LOUISE THORNDYKE _For Little Girls From 4 to 8 Years Old_ Honey
