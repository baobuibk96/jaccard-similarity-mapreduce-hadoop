Then we could get all the boys together and have a battle Its the best fun I know of next to swimming in the creek was the answer Here we are he cried a few minutes later and both boys stopped in front of a small shop window that looked very gay with a wonderful display of Christmas toys See those skates hanging up by that sled Thats the kind I want pointed out Reddy You screw them right into the heels of your shoes and you bet they cant ever come off Theyre fine agreed Toad but look at that engine and train It goes right through the tunnel and up over the bridge I wonder how fast it can run Thats a dandy mitt there said the other pointing to a baseball outfit I wouldnt be afraid to stop any kind of a ball with that on Wish my dad would get me a new sled like that flyer sighed Toad I finished mine last winter when I ran into that tree with you and Herbie on board You surely did was the laughing answer I remember how we all went flying head first into a snow drift Theres a nice pocket knife was Toads next remark I mean the one with the pearl handle just next to that doll with the pink dress on Oh! exclaimed Reddy heres what just suits me catching sight for the first time of a punching bag How do you work it? Why you see theres an elastic rope on each end of it and one of them you tie to a ring in the floor and the other to something overhead Then when you give it a punch it comes back to you with a bang Well Id rather have a football; then maybe we could get up a regular team remarked Toad Ill bet all those reals would cost about ten dollars ventured the other pointing to a box of marbles toward the front of the window If I was rich Id buy them What for? You have plenty You won nearly all mine away from me Look! he added in a low voice there goes Herbies mother into the store Lets see what she buys Hello Daddy greeted both the boys as old Mr Williams with his white hair red cheeks and dancing blue eyes came to the doorway of the shop and smiled at them Merry Christmas Merry Christmas! he replied Have you been good boys? I should say we have cried Toad Everybodys good before Christmas Well run along home then and Ill tell your mas just what you want promised Daddy Herbies mas in here now and she doesnt want you boys to know what she buys All right answered Reddy Dont forget to say I want a punching bag and a pair of skates And I want a new sled chimed in Toad as they both started off Shucks I didnt see half the things did you? protested Reddy Oh well we can come down again this afternoon was the cheering answer Come on over to my house anyway he called as they parted CHAPTER II THE SNOW FIGHT By evening the snow that Toad and Reddy had so eagerly awaited had come and by morning many inches had fallen A crowd of boys had gathered on the Browns lawn for the news of a snow battle had carried far First chooser! cried Charley Brown a happy-faced boy who bore the name of Chuck among his friends Second shouted Reddy and when the sides were chosen Toad found himself with Herbie a boy with whom he played very often and four others on Reddys side It was then decided by the choosers who were also the captains to build two forts ten yards apart and a half hour was agreed upon as time enough in which to do the work We must hurry Reddy told the boys he had chosen and I think he added in a low voice three of us had better build the fort while the other three make snowballs as we want a lot on hand so we wont have to stop firing to make them Work fast he ordered as he selected two of them to help him build the fort Toad piled up great heaps of snow while Reddy and Herbie packed it down with wooden spades into a wall which curved like a new moon How are the snowballs getting on boys? asked Toad of the three boys who were working hard making them Were stacking them up so theyll be easy to get at answered one Theyre good hard ones said another Its fine packing snow Were going to have plenty too laughed the third Wonder what Fats doing? cried Reddy Hes bringing a pail of water from the house Frank called Fat by the other boys because of his size was Reddys older brother I wonder mused Toad Hes pouring it on the walls of their fort Oh dont you see he added a moment later its to make it freeze Lets do that too proposed Herbie Ill get the water and he started for the house Ten minutes later the walls of the fort were like a solid mass of ice and the snowballs were inside in four heaps so all were anxious for the fun to begin Illustration Charge! shouted Reddy on the run the others close upon his heels CHAPTER III THE VICTORY Hey Captain of the enemy! shouted Chuck from the other fort are you ready? All ready came the answer Fire! A storm of snowballs flew through the air and Reddy barely had time to duck his head as they whizzed by Looks as though they had plenty of balls too exclaimed Toad hastily picking up an armful and running outside to get within closer range I dont think so protested Herbie I could see all of them working on the fort We have lots more Im sure Well cried the Captain let everybody take a pile of snowballs and well run out together and maybe we can drive them from their fort Each boy carried as many as he could in one arm this leaving the other one free to throw with Well have to make a quick run for it and throw just as fast and hard as we can said Herbie as Toad who had at that moment returned to the fort in a great hurry his hat covered with snow exclaimed They got me but I hit two or three of them! All ready! shouted the Captain and the others following close on his heels dashed out Such a hail of snowballs met them that they halted for a moment then dashed onward right up to the enemys fort Dont waste any ammunition until you get close ordered Reddy and his company obeyed Now let her fly he directed as they surrounded the fort The boys threw with a will and were vigorously answered by the defenders of the fort and for a time it was hard to see which side would win Finally after the ammunition of the attacking force was used up Captain Reddy ordered a retreat back to their own fort I have a better plan this time he announced after they were safely inside When we charge again two of you fellows must keep running back to our own fort so as to bring us supplies of snowballs Then we can keep up a much longer fight and when anyone gets tired throwing he added he can change places with one of the fellows that have been carrying the balls At this moment Herbie who had been on the lookout suddenly cried Theyre coming to charge us Get ready to give it to them ordered the Captain and each boy snatching up an armful of snowballs prepared to repel the attack Fire! Reddy shouted as the enemy drew near and when they met that rain of balls it didnt take them long to get back to the cover of their own fort That was great! cried Herbie Come on let us charge this time before they have a chance to get ready for us Hey Im the Captain insisted Reddy Nobody gives any orders but me and he pulled his woolen cap well down over his ears in preparation for the coming attack Well hurry up and give them then! shouted Toad Im all loaded up Charge charge on! shouted Reddy starting out on the run with the others close upon his heels and after a few minutes of hard fighting they had forced their way to the walls of the fort The balls were flying so thick and so fast from both sides that it looked like a snow storm of enormous flakes shooting in all directions The boys carrying balls to supply the invaders were kept busy but before long it was noticed that there were fewer coming from inside the fort Theyve used up all they have shouted Toad Lets get closer Close in cried Captain Reddy and aim well! In another minute you could plainly tell that each of the enemy after throwing one snowball had to stop long enough to make another one and this was the time for which Captain Reddy had been waiting Charge the walls! he ordered and with wild cries the boys dashed forward Up over the walls they went and once inside the victory was easily won for the boys inside the fort were empty handed and couldnt defend themselves We win we win! exclaimed Toad throwing his hat into the air Three cheers for Captain Reddy! Hurrah! shouted all the boys CHAPTER IV CHUCKS RUDE AWAKENING The day before Christmas dawned bright and cold Mother Brown who had been up early made some wonderful Christmas pies and a pudding before Toad and Chuck were awake It was eight oclock before Toad opened one eye Whats the use of getting up he thought Im so warm and comfortable here in bed My but something smells awfully good Wonder if its breakfast Suddenly he sat up straight in bed Look at that lazy thing he declared Bet hed sleep until noon if Id let him and with all we have to do to-day Chuck continued to snore peacefully But I wont--Ill have some fun thought Toad as quietly with as little noise as possible he crept from his bed to the basin in one corner of the room It took him only a few seconds to wet a large sponge with cold water then creeping very carefully back to the foot of Chucks bed he took careful aim The sponge flew through the air true to its mark and landed kersplash on Chucks tousled brown head W-w-w-whats the matter? spluttered Chuck sitting up and blinking his eyes Then as he felt the water trickling down his cheeks and caught sight of Toad doubled up with laughter he jumped out of bed and running across the room he pushed Toad flat on his back on the bed and sat upon his chest Let me up pleaded Toad I couldnt help it you looked so sweet Whatll you give me if I do? laughed Chuck Youve got to pay for that smart trick before I let you up Nothing! gasped Toad trying very hard to free himself Oho! laughed Chuck You wont eh? Well he added I dont mind sitting here all day Im real comfortable At this moment there came a knock at the door and before either of the boys could answer Father Brown entered Whats up? he inquired Toad hit me in the face with a wet sponge while I was asleep explained Chuck and hes going to give me something for it Then why are you sitting on him? asked Father Because he says he wont replied Chuck with a grin I suppose youll have to pay up Thomas laughed Father Anyway I hope youll both be down to breakfast soon he added--before all the cakes are gone Ive a terrible appetite this morning and with these words he left the room Do you give up now? asked Chuck No sir persisted Toad Remember what he said about the cakes Theyll be hot ones with lots of maple syrup teased Chuck Well youre missing them too retorted Toad I guess Ill let you off this time relented Chuck but if you ever do it again he threatened Ill hold you down for a week cakes or no cakes Youd starve to death in that time argued Toad with a laugh as he commenced to hurry into his clothing The boys were seated at the table a half hour later and had just eaten the last of the griddle cakes when Reddys whistle was heard Toad jumping up from the table ran over to the window and beckoned to Reddy to come into the house What are you going to do this morning? was Reddys first remark as he entered the room Were going for Christmas greens and Dads going to cut our tree from away up on the hillside Toad told him and he added were going to take one of the horses with us to drag it home Oh thats great! replied Reddy Do you start soon? Dont you want to go too? asked Chuck And maybe we can get Fat and Herbie too he added If such a crowd goes and everybody gathers greens laughed Toad what will we ever do with all of them? Mother Brown answered him from the doorway Why not take some of them to the church? Im sure the ladies who are trimming it will be glad to use all that you can give them Thats a splendid idea declared Father Brown rising from his seat by the fireplace Come boys bundle up well because its going to be a cold drive Ill run ahead to get the others called Chuck as he hurried from the room CHAPTER V THE ADVENTURE IN THE SNOW Im glad we brought the sleigh Father Brown remarked as they were driving along at a fair pace a little later as we never could have gotten through with a wagon in this deep snow They were now starting up the hill and the horses feet sank deeply into the snow drifts although his load was not heavy as the boys took turns walking so that only two of them were riding at a time When we reach the first clearing Father proposed well cut the greens and then leave them in a pile by the roadside for it is likely we shall have to go up still higher before we can find the tree we want After going on a few yards more he shouted Heres the place; all hands to work! and the boys started in with a will bringing to the roadside great heaps of boughs and woodvines some of them covered with red berries and others with grey Within a short time they had gathered a large pile of the greens so they decided it was time to start out to find the tree The tree must be full and the top perfect declared Father Brown so keep your eyes open for it Whats the matter with that one? demanded Toad pointing to a big fir some distance away Nothing at all the matter with it laughed Chuck only the house is too small to hold it Theres a nice one called out Herbie pointing to the one he meant Yes thats a beauty agreed Father Brown and easy to get at too After clearing away the smaller branches near the ground by chopping them off with the axe Father Brown then started to work on the trunk of the tree Wouldnt it be nice suggested Fat if we didnt have to cut it down at all--just trim it outside? It would save so much time and trouble Oh yes that would be great agreed Reddy Wed just sit around on the snow eating ice cream and look at the tree and he gave a hearty laugh in which all the others joined Well Ill bet they do it in Greenland and Iceland persisted Fat so why couldnt we? Because we dont wear white Polar bear clothes laughed Chuck There she comes--shes falling! cried the boys Stay where you are until its down called Father Brown to the boys Illustration There she comes! Shes falling! cried the boys There was a sharp creak and a swish of branches as the tree came down and the boys now rushed over to help tie up the branches When that part of the work was finished Reddy sang out All together! Lift her on the sled One two three! and up it went Nobody gets a ride home called out Chuck because the greens have to go on top of the tree Oh! wailed Fat if I cant ride Ill roll down I hate to walk By the time they had reached the fields the worst part of the trip was over Well cut over to the road that runs past the church said Father Brown and leave some of the greens there at which the horse was headed in that direction As they came to the road they saw a short distance from them an object in the snow and as they drew nearer it proved to be a little fellow deep in a snow drift His hands were blue with the cold and as Father Brown picked him up in his arms he tried to speak but couldnt I know who he is volunteered Herbie Hes Patsy OReilly and he lives over there pointing to a small house up the road His brother Mike goes to school with me he continued Ill carry him home said Father as you boys are able to handle things all right now saying which he started off to the little house with Patsy in his arms Chuck to whom Father Brown had handed the reins now started to drive the horse toward home When the boys arrived at the church and had carried in the greens the ladies were delighted and one of them even tried to kiss Reddy but he hurried away just in time CHAPTER VI TOADS UNSELFISHNESS When they reached home Chuck drove the sleigh up to the side door where the boys quickly unloaded the greens They then lifted the tree to the piazza and when this had been done Chuck drove the horse to the stable Lets go in and get our hands warm before we take in the greens suggested Toad and soon they were all laughing and talking before the great fire in the library Fat had just asked the others if they remembered the day Mr Brown had told them about the Indians that used to live in the woods where they found the tree when a mans voice was heard from the hall Its going to be a sad Christmas for them Im afraid for both parents are ill and the three helpless children are waiting for Santa Claus to come the boys heard Father Brown say How sad was Mrs Browns answer as they both went into the kitchen and the boys could hear no more They must be talking about the OReillys commented Fat Mikes a friend of mine and Im sorry he isnt going to have any Christmas So am I echoed Herbie after a short silence Chuck said hed hate to awaken Christmas morning and not find any presents Guess Ive been mighty selfish wanting so many things he thought Toad and Reddy who had moved away from the other boys were talking together in low excited whispers Then when the others went to the window to look at the green outside they slipped from the room and hurried down the hall to the kitchen Mother called Toad from the doorway may we speak to you for a minute? Mother Brown handed the bowl in which she had been stirring something to the cook and crossed the room toward the boys saying as she did so I can only spare a few minutes to-day Thomas for I am very busy But Mother exclaimed Toad we have a great idea! Its a Christmas surprise party chimed in Reddy for the OReillys and together the two boys went on to tell Mrs Brown of their plans If we could just have the horse and sleigh to get around in ventured Toad Do you think Father would allow us to hitch old Meg to the big sleigh? Its a wonderful idea agreed Mother Brown Suppose you ask him But how about presents for the three children? Have you thought of that? If it were only after Christmas we could give away some of our new things sighed Toad But would you give them away? asked his mother Supposing you were going to get a sled--the kind you have been wanting and she paused to hear Toads answer He thought very hard for a moment then answered Yes because I always get a lot of things and it might be the only present Mike would get Well remarked his mother I have bought you a sled and you may give it to him Reddy looked at Toad as Mother Brown turned toward the kitchen Are you sorry now that you said yes? he asked No Im not returned Toad Well Ill ask Mother to let me give them something new of mine too declared Reddy consolingly putting his arm about Toads shoulder CHAPTER VII THE BOYS PLAN A SURPRISE At two oclock the sleigh was ready for Father Brown had willingly given the boys permission to use it that afternoon It was planned to have Chuck drive for Toad Reddy Fat and Herbie expected to be too busy calling at the different houses to gather the presents which they hoped to collect for the OReillys Lets stop at Baileys first suggested Fat as were sure to get something there Wholl go to the door? questioned Herbie All go answered Chuck Thats the best way So in a group they rang the bell and waited Chuck remaining in the sleigh No one came in answer to their ring All out sighed Fat; but Toad gave the bell another pull Bet theyre all in the kitchen baking things and didnt hear it he remarked Theres someone coming now whispered Reddy and as the door opened Good afternoon said all the boys in chorus Mercy upon us where did you all come from? exclaimed Mrs Bailey and as Toad held forth a card that Father Brown had printed for them she asked Am I to read this? Yes Mrs Bailey that explains everything Reddy told her She read-- In one little home there may be no Christmas cheer; the father and mother are both ill There are three children; a boy of nine years another of five and a girl of seven They need coal clothing food and toys _What will you give?_ So youre all playing at being Santa Claus remarked Mrs Bailey with a smile Well I believe I can find something that will please you so just stop in on your way back and Ill have it all ready for you Oh thank you! cried all the boys together as they started for the sleigh happy over the success of their first call Have any luck? asked Chuck But I can see you did because youre all grinning he added as they told him what Mrs Bailey had promised After several more visits with the promise of something from each place if they would call later Herbie proposed that they stop at Mrs Lees home as Mary Lee had a great many dolls and might give them one of them for the little OReilly girl Thats a good idea they all agreed and the idea was carried out When Mrs Lee had read the card she asked the boys if there was anything they needed that had not been promised We wondered replied Herbie if Mary would give us a doll for that little girl? Mrs Lee smiled and said I think I can promise you that she will If you will call later it will give me a chance to get her Well be glad to promised the boys and thank you At five oclock a sleigh piled high with bundles and boys was seen turning into the Browns driveway Whatll we do now? asked Toad of the others Illustration Framed in the doorway stood a boy gazing at a heap of bundles Lets drive into the barn and leave the things in the sleigh suggested Chuck; then we can meet here early tonight and take the things to the OReillys All right assented the others What time shall we meet? At seven oclock said Toad CHAPTER VIII WHAT MIKE FOUND After dinner that night Chuck and Toad spent a little time helping to trim the big tree that had been put in place in the library during their absence of the afternoon Chuck was on the top of a stepladder tying shiny colored balls to the upper branches when Toad who had been busy with candy canes and popcorn balls suddenly stopped and looked at the clock on the mantel Its seven oclock Chuck he cried and the others will be wondering why we dont come out and at this he ran into the hall to get into his coat and cap Chuck took but a second to follow Toad out into the yard to meet the boys Mother Brown had sent her bundle and Toads new sled to the barn by John the stableman who put them into the sleigh with the other things while the boys were at dinner Hello boys! Everybody here? inquired Toad as he joined the group of boys in front of the barn All but Fat laughed Reddy and hell be along in a minute He said I walked too fast for him Is everything in the sleigh? asked Herbie as John was hitching up Everythings in all right Toad assured him When about to start they found that the sleigh was so full of bundles that some of the boys had to stand on the runners Just as they reached the street Fat was seen coming toward them Hurry up lazy bones called Reddy or youll get left but John good-naturedly stopped the horse until Fat had climbed aboard There was a full moon and the sky was bright with stars The snow was hard beneath the horses feet which made the going easy so they traveled along at a brisk pace Where shall I stop? asked John as they drew near the OReillys cottage Just a little this side of the house directed Toad so they wont hear us All off now ordered Reddy as John pulled up the horse and help unload Dont lets make any more noise than we can help We can pile everything on the front steps whispered Herbie as the boys each heavily laden with packages of all sizes and shapes walked very quietly up the path toward the house Each carefully placed his bundles or boxes where Herbie had suggested and just as silently they now returned to the sleigh Suppose someone comes along and takes all the things before they get up in the morning? argued Fat I dont think its safe to leave them there all night do you? Well maybe wed better throw some snowballs at the door proposed Chuck to bring them out now This was accepted as a good plan and Bang bang bang! went the balls against the door The sleigh in which the boys took refuge was well hidden behind a pine tree so they could not be seen from the house Theres a light! said Reddy in a low voice Someone is opening the door Its Mike! answered Herbie excitedly Ill bet he cant believe his eyes It did seem to the others that what Herbie said was true for framed in the doorway of the cottage stood a boy gazing at a great heap of bundles and boxes on the steps before him as if dazed Once he rubbed his eyes as if to make sure he was awake then he slowly stretched out one hand toward the beautiful new sled hardly daring to believe it was real Then suddenly as the boys watched eagerly the sled was in his arms and he was jumping up and down with joy calling to those of his family who could to come out to see the wonderful surprise Time for us to be getting home now whispered Chuck and Toad feeling very happy answered I guess youre right By nine oclock Chuck and Toad were sound asleep and the stockings tied to the end of each bed fell limp and empty CHAPTER IX CHRISTMAS MORNING Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! shouted Toad It was seven oclock and Chuck awoke with a start and looked around him Merry Christmas he answered and both boys scrambled down to the foot of their beds to untie the stockings full to overflowing with candies nuts oranges and many small gifts Oh! cried Chuck see what I have holding his stocking up by the foot and shaking the contents out on the bed A big knife and a top and some reals So have I! By jinks Im glad to get the knife--its a beauty three blades! Chuck who by this time had a whole candy apple in his mouth could only nod his head in reply Lets hurry up and dress so we can go down to see the tree proposed Toad Ill bet there will be lots more things for us down there and this the boys hastened to do Merry Christmas greeted Mother Brown a few minutes later as the boys now fully dressed came to her door Merry Christmas boys called their father from the hall below as Mother Brown and the boys hurried downstairs As they entered the library the very first thing that met Toads eyes was a beautiful new sled much larger than the one he had given the night before to Michael OReilly Oh is that for me? he cried in delight as he pounced upon it I didnt expect to get one Yes my son answered his father it is for you Oh wait until Reddy sees this! and Toad fairly hopped about in his delight Chuck was very much excited over a new building game the very thing he had hoped for but Toad hardly had time to look at his other gifts from his many aunts and uncles so anxious was he to go out doors to try his new sled After breakfast Mother Brown helped him into his coat and found his mittens and cap for they always seemed to run away and hide while Toad slept Come on Chuck! he cried Arent you coming out? Nope Im going to see if I can build a derrick was the reply so Toad started off alone As he reached the hill down which most of the boys liked best to coast he met Reddy trudging along with his sled Hey Merry Christmas he shouted Look at what Dad gave me! Merry Christmas answered Reddy Jingoes thats a beauty! Did you get the football you wanted? he was asked You bet I did and a punching bag too Like the one in Daddy Williams window? inquired Toad Just like it and when you give it a punch whack! it comes back at you quick as a flash What did Fat get? Oh a lot of books and a pair of ice skates replied Reddy so hes gone over to Whites pond to try them Chuck got his building game; you know the one he wanted and he wouldnt come out declared Toad in fine disgust Hes making things with it Whos that just starting? and Reddy pointed up the long hill where some one was getting ready to coast down Well if it isnt Mike OReilly! he exclaimed--here ahead of us Then as the sled with Mike lying flat on it shot past them they greeted him with a shout Hello returned Mike his face all aglow with joy look at what I got for Christmas Bet youre glad now that you gave it to him said Reddy as the two boys reached the top of the hill Let me go down with you the first trip? You bet! Toad assented Merry Christmas Reddy shouted giving the sled a push from behind One two three were off and down they flew Shes speedy all right he declared as the cold north wind stung his cheeks And she steers like a bird echoed Toad THE END THE MERRYVALE GIRLS By ALICE HALE BURNETT * * * * * Four delightful books for the smaller girls each a complete story in itself describing in simple language
