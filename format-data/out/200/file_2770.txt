EDUCATION AHEAD BRAVE WORK AND THE REWARD POLLY IS COMFORTED PHRONSIE GETTING READY FOR MAMSIE AND THE BOYS WHICH TREATS OF A GOOD MANY MATTERS POLLYS DISMAL MORNING POLLYS BIG BUNDLE FIVE LITTLE PEPPERS A HOME VIEW The little old kitchen had quieted down from the bustle and confusion of mid-day; and now with its afternoon manners on presented a holiday aspect that as the principal room in the brown house it was eminently proper it should have It was just on the edge of the twilight; and the little Peppers all except Ben the oldest of the flock were enjoying a x93breathing spellx94 as their mother called it which meant some quiet work suitable for the hour All the x93breathing spellx94 they could remember however poor things; for times were always hard with them nowadays; and since the father died when Phronsie was a baby Mrs Pepper had had hard work to scrape together money enough to put bread into her childrens mouths and to pay the rent of the little brown house But she had met life too bravely to be beaten down now So with a stout heart and a cheery face she had worked away day after day at making coats and tailoring and mending of all descriptions; and she had seen with pride that couldnt be concealed her noisy happy brood growing up around her and filling her heart with comfort and making the little brown house fairly ring with jollity and fun x93Poor things!x94 she would say to herself x93they havent had any bringing up; theyve just scrambled up!x94 And then she would set her lips together tightly and fly at her work faster than ever x93I must get schooling for them some way but I dont see how!x94 Once or twice she had thought x93Now the time is coming!x94 but it never did for winter shut in very cold and it took so much more to feed and warm them that the money went faster than ever And then when the way seemed clear again the store changed hands so that for a long time she failed to get her usual supply of sacks and coats to make; and that made sad havoc in the quarters and half-dollars laid up as her nest egg But--x93Well itll come some timex94 she would say to herself; x93because it must!x94 And so at it again she would fly brisker than ever x93To help motherx94 was the great ambition of all the children older and younger; but in Pollys and Bens souls the desire grew so overwhelmingly great as to absorb all lesser thoughts Many and vast were their secret plans by which they were to astonish her at some future day which they would only confide--as they did everything else--to one another For this brother and sister were everything to each other and stood loyally together through x93thick and thinx94 Polly was ten and Ben one year older; and the younger three of the x93Five Little Peppersx94 as they were always called looked up to them with the intensest admiration and love What they failed to do couldnt very well be done by any One! x93Oh dear!x94 exclaimed Polly as she sat over in the corner by the window helping her mother pull out basting threads from a coat she had just finished and giving an impatient twitch to the sleeve x93I do wish we could ever have any light--just as much as we want!x94 x93You dont need any light to see these threadsx94 said Mrs Pepper winding up hers carefully as she spoke on an old spool x93Take care Polly you broke that; threads dear nowx94 x93I couldnt help itx94 said Polly vexedly; x93it snapped; everythings dear now it seems to me! I wish we could have--oh! ever an ever so many candles; as many as we wanted Id light em all so there! and have it light here one night anyway!x94 x93Yes and go dark all the rest of the year like as anywayx94 observed Mrs Pepper stopping to untie a knot x93Folks who do so never have any candlesx94 she added sententiously x93How manyd you have Polly?x94 asked Joel curiously laying down his hammer and regarding her with the utmost anxiety x93Oh two hundred!x94 said Polly decidedly x93Id have two hundred all in a row!x94 x93Two hundred candles!x94 echoed Joel in amazement x93My whockety! what a lot!x94 x93Dont say such dreadful words Joelx94 put in Polly nervously stopping to pick up her spool of basting thread that was racing away all by itself; x93tisnt nicex94 x93Tisnt worse than to wish youd got things you haventx94 retorted Joel x93I dont believe youd light em all at oncex94 he added incredulously x93Yes I would too!x94 replied Polly reckessly; x93two hundred of em if I had a chance; all at once so there Joey Pepper!x94 x93Ohx94 said little Davie drawing a long sigh x93Why twould be just like heaven Polly! but wouldnt it cost money though!x94 x93I dont carex94 said Polly giving a flounce in her chair which snapped another thread; x93oh dear me! I didnt mean to mammy; well I wouldnt care how much money it cost wed have as much light as we wanted for once; so!x94 x93Mercy!x94 said Mrs Pepper x93youd have the house afire! Two hundred candles! who ever heard of such a thing!x94 x93Would they burn?x94 asked Phronsie anxiously getting up from the floor where she was crouching with David overseeing Joel nail on the cover of an old box; and going to Pollys side she awaited her answer patiently x93Burn?x94 said Polly x93There thats done now mamsie dear!x94 And she put the coat with a last little pat into her mothers lap x93I guess they would Phronsie petx94 And Polly caught up the little girl and spun round and round the old kitchen till they were both glad to stop x93Thenx94 said Phronsie as Polly put her down and stood breathless after her last glorious spin x93I do so wish we might Polly; oh just this very one minute!x94 And Phronsie clasped her fat little hands in rapture at the thought x93Wellx94 said Polly giving a look up at the old clock in the corner; x93deary me! its half-past five; and most time for Ben to come home!x94 Away she flew to get supper So for the next few moments nothing was heard but the pulling out of the old table into the middle of the floor the laying the cloth and all the other bustle attendant upon the being ready for Ben Polly went skipping around cutting the bread and bringing dishes; only stopping long enough to fling some scraps of reassuring nonsense to the two boys who were thoroughly dismayed at being obliged to remove their traps into a corner Phronsie still stood just where Polly left her Two hundred candles! oh! what could it mean! She gazed up to the old beams overhead and around the dingy walls and to the old black stove with the fire nearly out and then over everything the kitchen contained trying to think how it would seem To have it bright and winsome and warm! to suit Polly--x93oh!x94 she screamed x93Goodness!x94 said Polly taking her head out of the old cupboard in the corner x93how you scared me Phronsie!x94 x93Would they ever go out?x94 asked the child gravely still standing where Polly left her x93What?x94 asked Polly stopping with a dish of cold potatoes in her hand x93What Phronsie?x94 x93Why the candlesx94 said the child x93the ever-an-ever so many pretty lights!x94 x93Oh my senses!x94 cried Polly with a little laugh x93havent you forgotten that! Yes--no that is Phronsie if we could have em at all we wouldnt ever let em go out!x94 x93Not once?x94 asked Phronsie coming up to Polly with a little skip and nearly upsetting her potatoes and all--x93not once Polly truly?x94 x93No not forever-an-everx94 said Polly; x93take care Phronsie! there goes a potato; no wed keep em always!x94 x93No you dont want tox94 said Mrs Pepper coming out of the bedroom in time to catch the last words; x93they wont be good to-morrow; better have them to-night Pollyx94 x93Maam!x94 said Polly setting down her potato-dish on the table and staring at her mother with all her might--x93have what mother?x94 x93Why the potatoes to be surex94 replied Mrs Pepper; x93didnt you say you better keep them child?x94 x93Twasnt potatoes--at allx94 said Polly with a little gasp; x93twas--dear me! heres Ben!x94 For the door opened and Phronsie with a scream of delight bounded into Bens arms x93Its just jollyx94 said Ben coming in his chubby face all aglow and his big blue eyes shining so honest and true; x93its just jolly to get home! supper ready Polly?x94 x93Yesx94 said Polly; x93that is--all but--x94 and she dashed off for Phronsies eating apron x93Sometimex94 said Phronsie with her mouth half full when the meal was nearly over x93were going to be awful rich; we are Ben truly!x94 x93No?x94 said Ben affecting the most hearty astonishment; x93you dont say so Chick!x94 x93Yesx94 said Phronsie shaking her yellow head very wisely at him and diving down into her cup of very weak milk and water to see if Polly had put any sugar in by mistake--a proceeding always expectantly observed x93Yes we are really Bensie very dreadful rich!x94 x93I wish we could be rich now thenx94 said Ben taking another generous slice of the brown bread; x93in time for mamsies birthdayx94 and he cast a sorrowful glance at Polly x93I knowx94 said Polly; x93oh dear! if we only could celebrate it!x94 x93I dont want any other celebrationx94 said Mrs Pepper beaming on them so that a little flash of sunshine seemed to hop right down on the table x93than to look round on you all; Im rich now and thats a fact!x94 x93Mamsie dont mind her five bothersx94 cried Polly jumping up and running to hug her mother; thereby producing a like desire in all the others who immediately left their seats and followed her example x93Mothers rich enoughx94 ejaculated Mrs Pepper; her bright black eyes glistening with delight as the noisy troop filed back to their bread and potatoes; x93if we can only keep together dears and grow up good so that the little brown house wont be ashamed of us thats all I askx94 x93Wellx94 said Polly in a burst of confidence to Ben after the table had been pushed back against the wall the dishes nicely washed wiped and set up neatly in the cupboard and all traces of the meal cleared away; x93I dont care; lets try and get a celebration somehow for mamsie!x94 x93How are you going to do it?x94 asked Ben who was of a decidedly practical turn of mind and thus couldnt always follow Polly in her flights of imagination x93I dont knowx94 said Polly; x93but we must some wayx94 x93Phoh! thats no goodx94 said Ben disdainfully; then seeing Pollys face he added kindly x93lets think though; and perhaps therell be some wayx94 x93Oh I knowx94 cried Polly in delight; x93I know the very thing Ben! lets make her a cake; a big one you know and--x94 x93Shell see you bake itx94 said Ben; x93or else shell smell it and thatd be just as badx94 x93No she wont eitherx94 replied Polly x93Dont you know shes going to help Mrs Henderson to-morrow; so there!x94 x93So she isx94 said Ben; x93good for you Polly you always think of everything!x94 x93And thenx94 said Polly with a comfortable little feeling at her heart at Bens praise x93why we can have it all out of the way splendidly you know when she comes home--and besides Grandma Bascomll tell me how You know weve only got brown flour Ben; I mean to go right over and ask her nowx94 x93Oh no you mustntx94 cried Ben catching hold of her arm as she was preparing to fly off x93Mammyll find it out; better wait till to-morrow; and besides Polly--x94 And Ben stopped unwilling to dampen this propitious beginning x93The stovell act like everything to-morrow! I know twill; then whatll you do!x94 x93It shant!x94 said Polly running up to look it in the face; x93if it does Ill shake it; the mean old thing!x94 The idea of Pollys shaking the lumbering old black affair sent Ben into such a peal of laughter that it brought all the other children running to the spot; and nothing would do but they must one and all be told the reason So Polly and Ben took them into confidence which so elated them that half an hour after when long past her bedtime Phronsie declared x93Im not going to bed! I want to sit up like Polly!x94 x93Dont tease herx94 whispered Polly to Ben who thought she ought to go; so she sat straight up on her little stool winking like everything to keep awake At last as Polly was in the midst of one of her liveliest sallies over tumbled Phronsie a sleepy little heap upon the floor x93I want--to go--to bed!x94 she said; x93take me--Polly!x94 x93I thought sox94 laughed Polly and bundled her off into the bedroom MAKING HAPPINESS FOR MAMSIE And so the minute her mother had departed for the ministers house next morning and Ben had gone to his days work chopping wood for Deacon Blodgett Polly assembled her force around the old stove and proceeded to business She and the children had been up betimes that morning to get through with the work; and now as they glanced around with a look of pride on the neatly swept floor the dishes all done and everything in order the moment their mothers back was turned they began to implore Polly to hurry and begin x93Its most leven oclockx94 said Joel who having no work to do outside that day was prancing around wild to help along the festivities; x93its most leven oclock Polly Pepper! you wont have it donex94 x93Oh no; tisnt either Joe;x94 said Polly with a very flushed face and her arms full of kindlings glancing up at the old clock as she spoke; x93tisnt but quarter of nine; there take care Phronsie! you cant lift off the cover; do help her Daviex94 x93No; let me!x94 cried Joel springing forward; x93its my turn; Dave got the shingles; its my turn Pollyx94 x93So tisx94 said Polly; x93I forgot; therex94 as she flung in the wood and poked it all up in a nice little heap coaxingly x93It cant help but burn; what a cake well have for mamsie!x94 x93Itll be so bigx94 cried Phronsie hopping around on one set of toes x93that mamsie wont know what to do will she Polly?x94 x93No I dont believe she willx94 said Polly gayly stuffing in more wood; x93Oh dear! there goes Bens putty; its all come out!x94 x93So it hasx94 said Joel going around back of the stove to explore; and then he added cheerfully x93its biggern ever; oh! its an awful big hole Polly!x94 x93Now whatever shall we do!x94 said Polly in great distress; x93that hateful old crack! and Bens clear off to Deacon Blodgetts!x94 x93Ill run and get himx94 cried Joel briskly; x93Ill bring him right home in ten minutesx94 x93Oh no you must not Joex94 cried Polly in alarm; x93it wouldnt ever be right to take him off from his work; mamsie wouldnt like itx94 x93What will you do then?x94 asked Joel pausing on his way to the door x93Im sure I dont knowx94 said Polly getting down on her knees to examine the crack; x93I shall have to stuff it with paper I sposex94 x93Twont stay inx94 said Joel scornfully; x93dont you know you stuffed it before last week?x94 x93I knowx94 said Polly with a small sigh; and sitting down on the floor she remained quite still for a minute with her two black hands thrust out straight before her x93Cant you fix it?x94 asked Davie soberly coming up; x93then we cant have the cakex94 x93Dear me!x94 exclaimed Polly springing up quickly; x93dont be afraid; were going to have that cake! There you ugly old thing you!x94 (this to the stove) x93see what youve done!x94 as two big tears flew out of Phronsies brown eyes at the direful prospect; and the sorrowful faces of the two boys looked up into Pollys own for comfort x93I can fix it I most know; do get some paper Joe as quick as you canx94 x93Dont know where there is anyx94 said Joel rummaging around; x93its all tore up; xcept the almanac; cant I take that?x94 x93Oh dear no!x94 cried Polly; x93put it right back Joe; I guess theres some in the wood-shedx94 x93There isnt eitherx94 said little Davie quickly; x93Joel and I took it to make kites withx94 x93Oh dearx94 groaned Polly; x93I dont know what we shall do; unlessx94 as a bright thought struck her x93you let me have the kites boysx94 x93Cantx94 said Joel; x93theyre all flew away; and torn upx94 x93Well now childrenx94 said Polly turning round impressively upon them the effect of which was heightened by the extremely crocky appearance she had gained in her explorations x93we must have some paper or something to stop up that old hole with--some way there!x94 x93I knowx94 said little Davie x93where well get it; its upstairs;x94 and without another word he flew out of the room and in another minute he put into Pollys hand an old leather boot-top one of his most treasured possessions x93You can chip itx94 he said x93real fine and then twill go inx94 x93So we canx94 said Polly; x93and youre a real good boy Davie to give it; thats a splendid present to help celebrate for mamsie!x94 x93Id a-given a boot-topx94 said Joel looking grimly at the precious bit of leather which Polly was rapidly stripping into little bits x93if Id a-hed it; I dont have anything!x94 x93I know you would Joeyx94 said Polly kindly; x93there now youll stay I guess!x94 as with the united efforts of the two boys cheered on by Phronsies enthusiastic little crow of delight the leather was crowded into place and the fire began to burn x93Now boysx94 said Polly getting up and drawing a long breath x93Im going over to Grandma Bascoms to get her to tell me how to make the cake; and you must stay and keep housex94 x93Im going to nailx94 said Joel; x93Ive got lots to dox94 x93All rightx94 said Polly tying on her hood; x93Phronsiell love to watch you; I wont be gone longx94 and she was off x93Grandma Bascomx94 wasnt really the childrens grandmother; only everybody in the village called her so by courtesy Her cottage was over across the lane and just a bit around the corner; and Polly flew along and up to the door fully knowing that now she would be helped out of her difficulty She didnt stop to knock as the old lady was so deaf she knew she wouldnt hear her but opened the door and walked in Grandma was sweeping up the floor already as neat as a pin; when she saw Polly coming she stopped and leaned on her broom x93Hows your ma?x94 she asked when Polly had said x93good morningx94 and then hesitated x93Oh mammys pretty wellx94 shouted Polly into the old ladys ear; x93and to-morrows her birthday!x94 x93To-morrowll be a bad day!x94 said grandma x93Oh dont never say that You mustnt borrow trouble childx94 x93I didntx94 said Polly; x93I mean--its her birthday grandma!x94 this last so loud that grandmas cap-border vibrated perceptibly x93The lands sakes tis!x94 cried Mrs Bascom delightedly; x93you dont say so!x94 x93Yesx94 said Polly skipping around the old lady and giving her a small hug; x93and were going to give her a surprisex94 x93What is the matter with her eyes?x94 asked grandma sharply turning around and facing her; x93shes been a-sewin too stiddy haint she?x94 x93A surprise!x94 shouted Polly standing upon tiptoe to bring her mouth on a level with the old ladys ear; x93a cake grandma a big one!x94 x93A cake!x94 exclaimed grandma dropping the broom to settle her cap which Polly in her extreme endeavors to carry on the conversation had knocked slightly awry; x93well thatll be finex94 x93Yesx94 said Polly picking up the broom and flinging off her hood at the same time; x93and oh! wont you please tell me how to make it grandma!x94 x93To be sure; to be sure;x94 cried the old lady delighted beyond measure to give advice; x93Ive got splendid receets; Ill go get em right offx94 and she ambled to the door of the pantry x93And Ill finish sweeping upx94 said Polly which grandma didnt hear; so she took up the broom and sent it energetically and merrily flying away to the tune of her own happy thoughts x93Yes theyre right in herex94 said grandma waddling back with an old tin teapot in her hand;--x93goodness child! what a dust youve kicked up! that aint the way to sweepx94 And she took the broom out of Pollys hand who stood quite still in mortification x93Therex94 she said drawing it mildly over the few bits she could scrape together and gently coaxing them into a little heap; x93thats the way; and then they dont go all over the room x93Im sorryx94 began poor Polly x93Taint any matterx94 said Mrs Bascom kindly catching sight of Pollys discomfited face; x93taint a mite of matter; youll sweep better next time; now lets go to the cake;x94 and putting the broom into the corner she waddled back again to the table followed by Polly and proceeded to turn out the contents of the teapot in search of just the right x93receetx94 But the right one didnt seem to appear; not even after the teapot was turned upside down and shaken by both grandmas and Pollys anxious hands Every other x93receetx94 seemed to tumble out gladly and stare them in the face--little dingy rolls of yellow paper with an ancient odor of spice still clinging to them; but all efforts to find this particular one failed utterly x93Wont some other one do?x94 asked Polly in the interval of fruitless searching when grandma bewailed and lamented and wondered x93where I could a put it!x94 x93No no childx94 answered the old lady; x93now where do you spose tis!x94 and she clapped both hands to her head to see if she could possibly remember; x93no no childx94 she repeated x93Why they had it down to my niece Mirandys weddin--twas just elegant! light as a feather; and twant rich eitherx94 she added; x93no eggs nor--x94 x93Oh I couldnt have eggs;x94 cried Polly in amazement at the thought of such luxury; x93and weve only brown flour grandma you knowx94 x93Well you can make it of brownx94 said Mrs Bascom kindly; x93when the raisins is in twill look quite nicex94 x93Oh we havent any raisinsx94 answered Polly x93Havent any raisins!x94 echoed grandma looking at her over her spectacles; x93what are you goin to put in?x94 x93Oh--cinnamonx94 said Polly briskly; x93weve got plenty of that and--itll be good I guess grandma!x94 she finished anxiously; x93anyway we must have a cake; there isnt any other way to celebrate mamsies birthdayx94 x93Well nowx94 said grandma bustling around; x93I shouldnt be surprised if you had real good luck Polly And your mall set ever so much by it; now if we only could find that receet!x94 and returning to the charge she commenced to fumble among her bits of paper again; x93I never shall forget how they eat on it; why there wasnt a crumb left Polly!x94 x93Oh dearx94 said Polly to whom x93Mirandys wedding cakex94 now became the height of her desires; x93if you only can find it! cant I climb up and look on the pantry shelves?x94 x93Maybe tis therex94 said Mrs Bascom slowly; x93you might try; sometimes I do put things away sos to have em safex94 So Polly got an old wooden chair according to direction and then mounted up on it with grandma below to direct she handed down bowl after bowl interspersed at the right intervals with cracked teacups and handleless pitchers But at the end of these explorations x93Mirandys wedding cakex94 was further off than ever x93Taint a mite o usex94 at last said the old lady sinking down in despair while Polly perched on the top of the chair and looked at her; x93I must a-give it awayx94 x93Cant I have the next best one then?x94 asked Polly despairingly feeling sure that x93Mirandys wedding cakex94 would have celebrated the day just right; x93and I must hurry right home pleasex94 she added getting down from the chair and tying on her hood; x93or Phronsie wont know what to dox94 So another x93receetx94 was looked over and selected; and with many charges and bits of advice not to let the oven get too hot etc etc Polly took the precious bit in her hand and flew over home x93Now weve got to--x94 she began bounding in merrily with dancing eyes; but her delight had a sudden stop as she brought up so suddenly at the sight within that she couldnt utter another word Phronsie was crouching a miserable little heap of woe in one corner of the mothers big calico-covered rocking-chair and crying bitterly while Joel hung over her in the utmost concern x93Whats the matter?x94 gasped Polly Flinging the x93receetx94 on the table she rushed up to the old chair and was down on her knees before it her arms around the little figure Phronsie turned and threw herself into Pollys protecting arms who gathered her up and sitting down in the depths of the chair comforted her as only she could x93What is it?x94 she asked of Joel who was nervously begging Phronsie not to cry; x93now tell me all thats happenedx94 x93I was a-nailingx94 began Joel; x93oh dear! dont cry Phronsie! do stop her Pollyx94 x93Go onx94 said Polly hoarsely x93I was a-nailingx94 began Joel slowly; x93and--and--Davies gone to get the peppermintx94 he added brightening up x93Tell me Joex94 said Polly x93all thats been going onx94 and she looked sternly into his face; x93or Ill get Davie tox94 as little Davie came running back with a bottle of castor oil which in his flurry he had mistaken for peppermint This he presented with a flourish to Polly who was too excited to see it x93Oh no!x94 cried Joel in intense alarm; x93Davie isnt going to! Ill tell Polly; I will trulyx94 x93Go on thenx94 said Polly; x93tell at once;x94 (feeling as if somebody didnt tell pretty quick she should tumble over) x93Wellx94 said Joel gathering himself up with a fresh effort x93the old hammer was a-shaking and Phronsie stuck her foot in the way--and--I couldnt help it Polly--no I just couldnt Pollyx94 Quick as a flash Polly tore off the little old shoe and well-worn stocking and brought to light Phronsies fat little foot Tenderly taking hold of the white toes the boys clustering around in the greatest anxiety she worked them back and forth and up and down x93Nothings brokenx94 she said at last and drew a long breath x93Its therex94 said Phronsie through a rain of tears; x93and it hurts Polly;x94 and she began to wiggle the big toe where around the nail was settling a small black spot x93Poor little toex94 began Polly cuddling up the suffering foot Just then a small and peculiar noise struck her ear; and looking up she saw Joel with a very distorted face making violent efforts to keep from bursting out into a loud cry All his attempts however failed; and he flung himself into Pollys lap in a perfect torrent of tears x93I didnt--mean to--Pollyx94 he cried; x93twas the--ugly old hammer! oh dear!x94 x93There there Joey dearx94 said Polly gathering him up in the other corner of the old chair close to her side; x93dont feel bad; I know you didnt mean tox94 and she dropped a kiss on his stubby black hair When Phronsie saw that anybody else could cry she stopped immediately and leaning over Polly put one little fat hand on Joels neck x93Dont cryx94 she said; x93does your toe ache?x94 At this Joel screamed louder than ever; and Polly was at her wits end to know what to do; for the boys heart was almost broken That he should have hurt Phronsie! the baby the pet of the whole house upon whom all their hearts centered--it was too much So for the next few moments Polly had all she could do by way of comforting and consoling him Just as she had succeeded the door opened and Grandma Bascom walked in x93Settin down?x94 said she; x93I hope your cake aint in Pollyx94 looking anxiously at the stove x93for Ive found it;x94 and she waved a small piece of paper triumphantly towards the rocking-chair as she spoke x93Do tell herx94 said Polly to little David x93whats happened; for I cant get upx94 So little Davie went up to the old lady and standing on tiptoe screamed into her ear all the particulars he could think of concerning the accident that had just happened x93Hey?x94 said grandma in a perfect bewilderment; x93whats he a-sayin Polly--I cant make it outx94 x93Youll have to go all over it again Davidx94 said Polly despairingly; x93she didnt hear one word I dont believex94 So David tried again; this time with better success And then he got down from his tiptoes and escorted grandma to Phronsie in flushed triumph x93Land alive!x94 said the old lady sitting down in the chair which he brought her; x93you got pounded did you?x94 looking at Phronsie as she took the little foot in her ample hand x93Yesmx94 said Polly quickly; x93twasnt any ones fault; whatll we do for it grandma?x94 x93Wormwoodx94 said the old lady adjusting her spectacles in extreme deliberation and then examining the little black and blue spot which was spreading rapidly x93is the very best thing; and Ive got some to home--you run right overx94 she said turning round on David quickly x93an get it; its a-hang-in by the chimbleyx94 x93Let me; let me!x94 cried Joel springing out of the old chair so suddenly that grandmas spectacles nearly dropped off in fright; x93oh! I want to do it for Phronsie!x94 x93Yes let Joel pleasex94 put in Polly; x93hell find it grandmax94 So Joel departed with great speed; and presently returned with a bunch of dry herbs which dangled comfortingly by his side as he came in x93Now Ill fix itx94 said Mrs Bascom getting up and taking off her shawl; x93theres a few raisins for you Polly; I dont want em and theyll make your cake go betterx94 and she placed a little parcel on the table as she spoke x93Yes Ill put it to steep; an after its put on real strong and tied up in an old cloth Phronsie wont know as shes got any toes!x94 and grandma broke up a generous supply of the herb and put it into an old tin cup which she covered up with a saucer and placed on the stove x93Oh!x94 said Polly; x93I cant thank you! for the raisins and all--youre so good!x94 x93Theyre awful hardx94 said Joel investigating into the bundle with Davie which however luckily the old lady didnt hear x93There dont tryx94 she said cheerily; x93an I found cousin Mirandys weddin cake receet for--x94 x93Did you?x94 cried Polly; x93oh! Im so glad!x94 feeling as if that were comfort enough for a good deal x93Yes twas in my Biblex94 said Mrs Bascom; x93I remember now; I put it there to be ready to give Johns folks when they come in; they wanted it; so youll go all straight now; and I must get home for I left some meat a-boilinx94 So grandma put on her shawl and waddled off leaving a great deal of comfort behind her x93Now says Ix94 said Polly to Phronsie when the little foot was snugly tied up in the wet wormwood x93youve got to have one of mamsies old slippersx94 x93Oh hox94 laughed Phronsie; x93wont that be funny Polly!x94 x93I should think it wouldx94 laughed Polly back again pulling on the big cloth slipper which Joel produced from the bedroom the two boys joining uproariously as the old black thing flapped dismally up and down and showed strong symptoms of flying off x93We shall have to tie it onx94 x93It looks like a pudding bagx94 said Joel as Polly tied it securely through the middle with a bit of twine; x93an old black pudding bag!x94 he finished x93Old black pudding bag!x94 echoed Phronsie with a merry little crow; and then all of a sudden she grew very sober and looked intently at the foot thrust out straight before her as she still sat in the chair x93What is it Phronsie?x94 asked Polly who was bustling around making preparations for the cake-making x93Can I ever wear my new shoes again?x94 asked the child gravely looking dismally at the black bundle before her x93Oh yes; my goodness yes!x94 cried Polly; x93as quick again as ever; youll be around again as smart as a cricket in a week--see if you arent!x94 x93Will it go on?x94 asked Phronsie still looking incredulously at the bundle x93and button up?x94 x93Yes indeed!x94 cried Polly again; x93button into every one of the little holes Phronsie Pepper; just as elegant as ever!x94 x93Oh!x94 said Phronsie; and then she gave a sigh of relief and thought no more of it because Polly had said that all would be right MAMSIES BIRTHDAY x93Run down and get the cinnamon will you Joey?x94 said Polly; x93its in the Provision Roomx94 The x93Provision Roomx94 was a little shed that was tacked on to the main house and reached by a short flight of rickety steps; so called because as Polly said x93twas a good place to keep provisions in even if we havent any; and besidesx94 she always finished x93it sounds nice!x94 x93Come on Dave! then well get something to eat!x94 So the cinnamon was handed up and then Joel flew back to Davie And now Pollys cake was done and ready for the oven With many admiring glances from herself and Phronsie who with Seraphina an extremely old but greatly revered doll tightly hugged in her arms was watching everything with the biggest of eyes from the depths of the old chair it was placed in the oven the door shut to with a happy little bang then Polly gathered Phronsie up in her arms and sat down in the chair to have a good time with her and to watch the process of cooking There was a bumping noise that came from the x93Provision Roomx94 that sounded ominous and then a smothered sound of words followed by a scuffling over the old floor x93Boys!x94 called Polly No answer; everything was just as still as a mouse x93Joel and David!x94 called Polly again in her loudest tones x93Yesx94 came up the crooked stairs in Davies voice x93Come up here right away!x94 went back again from Polly So up the stairs trudged the two boys and presented themselves rather sheepishly before the big chair x93What was that noise?x94 she asked; x93what have you been doing?x94 x93Twasnt anything but the pailx94 answered Joel not looking at her x93We had something to eatx94 said Davie by way of explanation; x93you always let usx94 x93I knowx94 said Polly; x93thats right you can have as much bread as you want to; but what you been doing with the pail?x94 x93Nothingx94 said Joel; x93twouldnt hangup thats allx94 x93And youve been bumping itx94 said Polly; x93oh! Joel how could you! You might have broken it; then what would mamsie say?x94 x93I didntx94 said Joel stoutly with his hands in his pockets x93bump it worsen Davie so there!x94 x93Why Daviex94 said Polly turning to him sorrowfully x93I shouldnt have thought you would!x94 x93Well Im tired of hanging it upx94 said little Davie vehemently; x93and I said I wasnt a-goin to; Joel always makes me; Ive done it for two million times I guess!x94 x93Oh dearx94 said Polly sinking back into the chair x93I dont know what I ever shall do; heres Phronsie hurt; and we want to celebrate to-morrow; and you two boys are bumping and banging out the bread pail and--x94 x93Oh! we wont!x94 cried both of the children perfectly overwhelmed with remorse; x93well hang it right upx94 x93Ill hang itx94 said Davie clattering off down the stairs with a will x93No I will!x94 shouted Joel going after him at double pace; and presently both came up with shining faces and reported it nicely done x93And nowx94 said Polly after they had all sat around the stove another half-hour watching and sniffing expectantly x93the cakes done!--dear me! its turning black!x94 And quickly as possible Polly twitched it out with energy and set it on the table Oh dear; of all things in the world! The beautiful cake over which so many hopes had been formed that was to have given so much happiness on the morrow to the dear mother presented a forlorn appearance as it stood there in anything but holiday attire It was quite black on the top in the center of which was a depressing little dump as if to say x93My feelings wouldnt allow me to rise to the occasionx94 x93Nowx94 said Polly turning away with a little fling and looking at the stove x93I hope youre satisfied you old thing; youve spoiled our mamsies birthday!x94 and without a bit of warning she sat right down in the middle of the floor and began to cry as hard as she could x93Well I never!x94 said a cheery voice that made the children skip x93Its Mrs Beebe; oh its Mrs Beebe!x94 cried Davie; x93see Pollyx94 Polly scrambled up to her feet ashamed to be caught thus and whisked away the tears; the others explaining to their new visitor the sad disappointment that had befallen them; and she was soon oh-ing and ah-ing enough to suit even their distressed little souls x93You poor creeters you!x94 she exclaimed at last for about the fiftieth time x93Here Polly heres some posies for you and--x94 x93Oh thank you!x94 cried Polly with a radiant face x93why Mrs Beebe we can put them in here cant we? the very thing!x94 And she set the little knot of flowers in the hollow of the cake and there they stood and nodded away to the delighted children like brave little comforters as they were x93The very thing!x94 echoed Mrs Beebe tickled to death to see their delight; x93it looks beautiful I declare! and now I must run right along or pall be worrying;x94 and so the good woman trotted out to her waiting husband who was impatient to be off Mr Beebe kept a little shoe shop in town; and always being of the impression if he left it for ten minutes that crowds of customers would visit it He was the most restless of companions on any pleasure excursion x93And Phronsies got hurtx94 said Mrs Beebe telling him the news as he finished tucking her up and started the old horse x93Ho? you dont say so!x94 he cried; x93whoa!x94 x93Dear me!x94 said Mrs Beebe; x93how you scat me pal whats the matter?x94 x93What?--the little girl that bought the shoes?x94 asked her husband x93Yesx94 replied his wife x93shes hurt her footx94 x93Sho nowx94 said the old gentleman; x93thats too badx94 and he began to feel in all his pockets industriously; x93there can you get out again and take her that?x94 and he laid a small piece of peppermint candy thick and white in his wifes lap x93Oh yesx94 cried Mrs Beebe good-naturedly beginning to clamber over the wheel So the candy was handed in to Phronsie who insisted that Polly should hold her up to the window to thank Mr Beebe So amid nods and shakings of hands the Beebes drove off and quiet settled down over the little brown house again x93Now childrenx94 said Polly after Phronsie had made them take a bite of her candy all around x93lets get the cake put away safe for mamsie may come home early x93Wherell you put it?x94 asked Joel wishing the world was all peppermint candy x93Oh--in the cupboardx94 said Polly taking it up; x93there Joe you can climb up and put it clear back in the corner oh! wait; I must take the posies off and keep them fresh in water;x94 so the cake was finally deposited in a place of safety followed by the eyes of all the children x93Nowx94 said Polly as they shut the door tight x93dont you go to looking at the cupboard Joey or mammyll guess somethingx94 x93Cant I just open it a little crack and take one smell when she isnt looking?x94 asked Joel; x93I should think you might Polly; just onex94 x93Nox94 said Polly firmly; x93not one Joe; shell guess if you dox94 But Mrs Pepper was so utterly engrossed with her baby when she came home and heard the account of the accident that she wouldnt have guessed if thered been a dozen cakes in the cupboard Joel was consoled as his mother assured him in a satisfactory way that she never should think of blaming him; and Phronsie was comforted and coddled to her hearts content And so the evening passed rapidly and happily away; Ben smuggling Phronsie off into a corner where she told him all the doings of the day--the disappointment of the cake and how it was finally crowned with flowers; all of which Phronsie with no small pride in being the narrator related gravely to her absorbed listener x93And dont you think Bensiex94 she said clasping her little hand in a convincing way over his two bigger stronger ones x93that Pollys stove was very naughty to make poor Polly cry?x94 x93Yes I dox94 said Ben and he shut his lips tightly together To have Polly cry hurt him more than he cared to have Phronsie see x93What are you staring at Joe?x94 asked Polly a few minutes later as her eyes fell upon Joel who sat with his back to the cupboard persistently gazing at the opposite wall x93Why you told me yourself not to look at the cupboardx94 said Joel in the loudest of stage whispers x93Dear me; thatll make mammy suspect worsen anything else if you look like thatx94 said Polly x93What did you say about the cupboard?x94 asked Mrs Pepper who caught Joes last word x93We cant tellx94 said Phronsie shaking her head at her mother; x93cause theres a ca----x94 x93Ugh!x94 and Polly clapped her hand on the childs mouth; x93dont you want Ben to tell us a story?x94 x93Oh yes!x94 cried little Phronsie in which all the others joined with a whoop of delight; so a most wonderful story drawn up in Bens best style followed till bedtime The first thing Polly did in the morning was to run to the old cupboard followed by all the others to see if the cake was safe; and then it had to be drawn out and dressed anew with the flowers for they had decided to have it on the breakfast table x93It looks betterx94 whispered Polly to Ben x93than it did yesterday; and arent the flowers pretty?x94 x93It looks good enough to eat anywayx94 said Ben smacking his lips x93Well we triedx94 said Polly stilling a sigh; x93now boys call mamsie; everythings readyx94 Oh! how surprised their mother appeared when she was ushered out to the feast and the full glory of the table burst upon her Her delight in the cake was fully enough to satisfy the most exacting mind She admired and admired it on every side protesting that she shouldnt have supposed Polly could possibly have baked it as good in the old stove; and then she cut it and gave a piece to every child with a little posy on top Wasnt it good though! for like many other things the cake proved better on trial than it looked and so turned out to be really quite a good surprise all around x93Why cant I ever have a birthday?x94 asked Joel finishing the last crumb of his piece; x93I should think I mightx94 he added reflectively x93Why you have Joex94 said Ben; x93eight of emx94 x93What a story!x94 ejaculated Joel; x93when did I have em? I never had a cake; did I Polly?x94 x93Not a cake-birthday Joelx94 said his mother; x93you havent got to that yetx94 x93Whens it coming?x94 asked Joel who was decidedly of a matter-of-fact turn of mind x93I dont knowx94 said Mrs Pepper laughing; x93but theres plenty of time aheadx94 TROUBLE FOR THE LITTLE BROWN HOUSE x93Oh I do wishx94 said Joel a few mornings after pushing back his chair and looking discontentedly at his bowl of mush and molasses x93that we could ever have something new besides this everlasting old breakfast! Why cant we mammy?x94 x93Better be glad youve got that Joex94 said Mrs Pepper taking another cold potato and sprinkling on a little salt; x93folks shouldnt complain so long as theyve anything to eatx94 x93But Im so tired of it--same old thing!x94 growled Joel; x93seems as if I shd turn into a meal-bag or a molasses jug!x94 x93Well hand it over thenx94 proposed Ben who was unusually hungry and had a hard days work before him x93Nox94 said Joel alarmed at the prospect and putting in an enormous mouthful; x93its better than nothingx94 x93Oh dearx94 said little Phronsie catching Joels tone x93it isnt nice; no it isntx94 And she put down her spoon so suddenly that the molasses spun off in a big drop that trailed off the corner of the table and made Polly jump up and run for the floor-cloth x93Oh Phronsiex94 she said reprovingly; x93you ought not to Never mind petx94 as she caught sight of two big tears trying to make a path in the little molasses-streaked face x93Pollyll wipe it upx94 x93Shant we ever have anything else to eat Polly?x94 asked the child gravely getting down from her high chair to watch the operation of cleaning the floor x93Oh yesx94 said Polly cheerfully x93lots and lots--when our ship comes inx94 x93Whatll they be?x94 asked Phronsie in the greatest delight prepared for anything x93Oh I dont knowx94 said Polly; x93ice cream for one thing Phronsie and maybe little cakesx94 x93With pink on top?x94 interrupted Phronsie getting down by Pollys side x93Oh yesx94 said Polly warming with her subject; x93ever and ever so much pink Phronsie Pepper; more than you could eat!x94 Phronsie just clasped her hands and sighed More than she could eat was beyond her! x93Hoh!x94 said Joel who caught the imaginary bill of fare x93thats nothing Polly Id speak for a plum-puddinx94 x93Like the one mother made us for Thanksgiving?x94 asked Polly getting up and waiting a minute cloth in hand for the answer x93Yes sirx94 said Joel shutting one eye and looking up at the ceiling musingly while he smacked his lips in remembrance; x93wasnt that prime though!x94 x93Yesx94 said Polly thoughtfully; x93would you have em all like that Joe?x94 x93Every onex94 replied Joe promptly; x93Id have seventy-five of emx94 x93Seventy-five what?x94 asked Mrs Pepper who had gone into the bedroom and now came out a coat in hand to sit down in the west window where she began to sew rapidly x93Better clear up the dishes Polly and set the table back--seventy-five what Joel?x94 x93Plum-puddingsx94 said Joel kissing Phronsie x93Dear me!x94 ejaculated Mrs Pepper; x93you dont know what youre saying Joel Pepper; the house couldnt hold em!x94 x93Wouldnt longx94 responded Joel; x93wed eat emx94 x93That would be foolishx94 interposed Ben; x93Id have roast beef and fixings--and oysters--and huckleberry piex94 x93Oh dearx94 cried Polly; x93how nice Ben! you always do think of the very best thingsx94 But Joel phoohed and declared he wouldnt waste his time x93over old beef; hed have something like!x94 And then he cried x93Come on Dave whatd you choose?x94 Little Davie had been quietly eating his breakfast amid all this chatter and somehow thinking it might make the mother feel badly he had refrained from saying just how tiresome he had really found this x93everlasting breakfastx94 as Joel called it But now he looked up eagerly his answer all ready x93Oh I knowx94 he cried x93what would be most beautiful! toasted bread--white bread--and candyx94 x93Whats candy?x94 asked Phronsie x93Oh dont you know Phronsiex94 cried Polly x93what Mrs Beebe gave you the day you got your shoes--the pink sticks; and--x94 x93And the peppermint stick Mr Beebe gave you Phronsiex94 finished Joel his mouth watering at the remembrance x93That day when you got your toe poundedx94 added Davie looking at Joel x93Oh!x94 cried Phronsie; x93I want some now I do!x94 x93Well Daviex94 said Polly x93you shall have that for breakfast when our ship comes in thenx94 x93Your ships arent ever comingx94 broke in Mrs Pepper wisely x93if you sit there talking--folks dont ever make any fortunes by wishingx94 x93True enoughx94 laughed Ben jumping up and setting back his chair x93Come on Joe; youve got to pile to-dayx94 x93Oh dearx94 said Joel dismally; x93I wish Mr Blodgetts wood was all a-firex94 x93Never say that Joelx94 said Mrs Pepper looking up sternly; x93its biting your own nose off to wish that wood was a-fire--and besides its dreadfully wickedx94 Joel hung his head for his mother never spoke in that way unless she was strongly moved; but he soon recovered and hastened off for his jacket x93Im sorry I cant help you do the dishes Pollyx94 said David running after Joel x93Im going to help herx94 said Phronsie; x93I amx94 So Polly got the little wooden tub that she always used gave Phronsie the well-worn cup-napkin and allowed her to wipe the handleless cups and cracked saucers which afforded the little one intense delight x93Dont you wish Pollyx94 said little Phronsie bustling around with a very important air nearly smothered in the depths of a big brown apron that Polly had carefully tied under her chin x93that you didnt ever-an-ever have so many dishes to do?x94 x93Um--maybex94 said Polly thoughtlessly She was thinking of something else besides cups and saucers just then; of how nice it would be to go off for just one day and do exactly as she had a mind to in everything She even envied Ben and the boys who were going to work hard at Deacon Blodgetts woodpile x93Well I tell youx94 said Phronsie confidentially setting down a cup that she had polished with great care x93Im going to do em all to-morrow for you Polly--I can truly; let me now Polly dox94 x93Nonsense!x94 said Polly giving a great splash with her mop in the tub ashamed of her inward repinings x93Phronsie youre no bigger than a mouse!x94 x93Yes I amx94 retorted Phronsie very indignantly Her face began to get very red and she straightened up so suddenly to show Polly just how very big she was that her little head came up against the edge of the tub--over it went! a pile of saucers followed x93There nowx94 cried Polly x93see what youve done!x94 x93Ow!x94 whimpered Phronsie breaking into a subdued roar; x93oh Polly! its all running down my backx94 x93Is it?x94 said Polly bursting out into a laugh; x93never mind Phronsie Ill dry youx94 x93Dear me Polly!x94 said Mrs Pepper who had looked up in time to see the tub racing along by itself towards the x93Provision Roomx94 door a stream of dish-water following in its wake x93she will be wet clear through; do get off her things quickx94 x93Yesmx94 cried Polly picking up the tub and giving two or three quick sops to the floor x93Here you are Pussyx94 grasping Phronsie crying as she was and carrying her into the bedroom x93Oh dearx94 wailed the child still holding the wet dish towel; x93I wont ever do it again if youll only let me do em all to-morrowx94 x93When youre big and strongx94 said Polly giving her a hug x93you shall do em every dayx94 x93May I really?x94 said little Phronsie blinking through the tears and looking radiant x93Yes truly--every dayx94 x93Then Ill grow right away I willx94 said Phronsie bursting out merrily; and she sat down and pulled off the well-worn shoes into which a big pool of dish-water had run while Polly went for dry stockings x93So you shallx94 said Polly coming back a big piece of gingerbread in her hand; x93and thisll make you grow Phronsiex94 x93O-o-h!x94 and Phronsies little white teeth shut down quickly on the comforting morsel Gingerbread didnt come often enough into the Pepper household to be lightly esteemed x93Nowx94 said Mrs Pepper when order was restored the floor washed up brightly and every cup and platter in place hobnobbing away to themselves on the shelves of the old corner cupboard and Polly had come as usual with needle and thread to help mother--Polly was getting so that she could do the plain parts on the coats and jackets which filled her with pride at the very thought--x93nowx94 said Mrs Pepper x93you neednt help me this morning Polly Im getting on pretty smart; but you may just run down to the parsons and see how he isx94 x93Is he sick?x94 asked Polly in awe To have the parson sick was something quite different from an ordinary persons illness x93Hes taken with a chillx94 said Mrs Pepper biting off a thread x93so Miss Huldy Folsom told me last night and Im afraid hes going to have a feverx94 x93Oh dearx94 said Polly in dire distress; x93whateverd we do mammy!x94 x93Dont know Im surex94 replied Mrs Pepper setting her stitches firmly; x93the Lordll provide So you run along child and see how he isx94 x93Cant Phronsie go?x94 asked Polly pausing half-way to the bedroom door x93Well yes I suppose she mightx94 said Mrs Pepper assentingly x93No she cant eitherx94 said Polly coming back with her sun-bonnet in her hand and shutting the door carefully after her x93cause shes fast asleep on the floorx94 x93Is she?x94 said Mrs Pepper; x93well shes been running so this morning shes tired out I sposex94 x93And her face is dreadfully redx94 continued Polly tying on her bonnet; x93now whatll I say mammy?x94 x93Well I should think twould bex94 said Mrs Pepper replying to the first half of Pollys speech; x93she cried so Well you just tell Mrs Henderson your ma wants to know how Mr Henderson is this morning and if twas a chill he had yesterday and how he slept last night and--x94 x93Oh max94 said Polly x93I cant ever remember all thatx94 x93Oh yes you canx94 said Mrs Pepper encouragingly; x93just put your mind on it Polly; tisnt anything to what I used to have to remember--when I was a little girl no bigger than you arex94 Polly sighed and feeling sure that something must be the matter with her mind gave her whole attention to the errand; till at last after a multiplicity of messages and charges not to forget any one of them Mrs Pepper let her depart Up to the old-fashioned green door with its brass knocker Polly went running over in her mind just which of the messages she ought to give first She couldnt for her life think whether x93if twas a chill he had yesterday?x94 ought to come before x93how he slept?x94 She knocked timidly hoping Mrs Henderson would help her out of her difficulty by telling her without the asking All other front doors in Badgertown were ornaments only opened on grand occasions like a wedding or a funeral But the ministers was accessible alike to all So Polly let fall the knocker and awaited the answer A scuffling noise sounded along the passage; and then Pollys soul sank down in dire dismay It was the ministers sister and not gentle little Mrs Henderson She never could get on with Miss Jerusha in the least She made her feel as she told her mother once--x93as if I dont know what my name isx94 And now here she was; and all those messages Miss Jerusha unbolted the door slid back the great bar opened the upper half and stood there She was a big woman with sharp black eyes and spectacles--over which she looked--which to Polly was much worse for that gave her four eyes x93Well and what do you want?x94 she asked x93I came to see--I mean my ma sent mex94 stammered poor Polly x93And who is your ma?x94 demanded Miss Jerusha as much like a policeman as anything; x93and where do you live?x94 x93I live in Primrose Lanex94 replied Polly wishing very much that she was back there x93I dont want to know where you live before I know who you arex94 said Miss Jerusha; x93you should answer the question I asked first; always remember thatx94 x93My mas Mrs Pepperx94 said Polly x93Mrs who?x94 repeated Miss Jerusha By this time Polly was so worn that she came very near turning and fleeing but she thought of her mothers disappointment in her and the loss of the news and stood quite still x93What is it Jerusha?x94 a gentle voice here broke upon Pollys ear x93I dont knowx94 responded Miss Jerusha tartly still holding the door much as if Polly were a robber; x93its a little girl and I cant make out what she wantsx94 x93Why its Polly Pepper!x94 exclaimed Mrs Henderson pleasantly x93Come in childx94 She opened the other half of the big door and led the way through the wide hall into a big old-fashioned room with painted floor and high old side-board and some stiff-backed rocking-chairs Miss Jerusha stalked in also and seated herself by the window and began to knit Polly had just opened her mouth to tell her errand when the door also opened suddenly and Mr Henderson walked in x93Oh!x94 said Polly and then she stopped and the color flushed up into her face x93What is it my dear?x94 and the minister took her hand kindly and looked down into her flushed face x93You are not going to have a fever and be sick and die!x94 she cried x93I hope not my little girlx94 he smiled back encouragingly; and then Polly gave her messages which now she managed easily enough x93Therex94 broke in Miss Jerusha x93a cat cant sneeze in this town but everybodyll know it in quarter of an hourx94 And then Mrs Henderson took Polly out to see a brood of new little chicks that had just popped their heads out into the world; and to Polly down on her knees admiring the time passed very swiftly indeed x93Now I must go maamx94 she said at last looking up into the ladys face regretfully x93for mammy didnt say I was to stayx94 x93Very well dear;

And with a cold heavy feeling at her heart Polly realized that this was no play x93Oh Ben!x94 she cried flinging her arms around his neck and bursting into tears; x93dont! please--I wish you wouldnt; Phronsies got em and thats enough!x94 x93Got what?x94 asked Ben while Davies eyes grew to their widest proportions x93Oh measles!x94 cried Polly bursting out afresh; x93the hate-fullest horridest measles! and now youre taken!x94 x93Oh no Im notx94 responded Ben cheerfully who knew what measles were; x93wipe up Polly; Im all right; only my head aches and my eyes feel funnyx94 But Polly only half-reassured controlled her sobs; and the sorrowful trio repaired to mother x93Oh dear!x94 ejaculated Mrs Pepper sinking in a chair in dismay at sight of Bens red face; x93whateverll we do now!x94 The prop and stay of her life would be taken away if Ben should be laid aside No more stray half or quarter dollars would come to help her out when she didnt know where to turn Polly cleared off the deserted table--for once Joel had all the bread and butter he wanted Ben took some of Phronsies medicine and crawled up into the loft to bed; and quiet settled down on the little household x93Pollyx94 whispered Ben as she tucked him in x93itll be hard buckling-to now for you but I guess youll do itx94 MORE TROUBLE x93Oh dearx94 said Polly to herself the next morning trying to get a breakfast for the sick ones out of the inevitable mush; x93everythings just as bad as it can be! they cant ever eat this; I wish I had an ocean of toast!x94 x93Toast some of the bread in the pail Pollyx94 said Mrs Pepper She looked worn and worried; she had been up nearly all night back and forth from Bens bed in the loft to restless fretful little Phronsie in the big four-poster in the bedroom; for Phronsie wouldnt get into the crib Polly had tried her best to help her and had rubbed her eyes diligently to keep awake but she was wholly unaccustomed to it and her healthy tired little body succumbed--and then when she awoke shame and remorse filled her very heart x93That isnt nice max94 she said glancing at the poor old pail which she had brought out of the x93Provision Roomx94 x93Old brown bread! I want to fix em something nicex94 x93Well you cant you knowx94 said Mrs Pepper with a sigh; x93but youve got butter now; thatll be splendid!x94 x93I know itx94 said Polly running to the corner cupboard where the precious morsel in the blue bowl remained; x93whatever should we do without it mammy?x94 x93Do without it!x94 said Mrs Pepper; x93sames we have donex94 x93Well twas splendid in Mrs Henderson to give it to us anywayx94 said Polly longing for just one taste; x93seems as if twas a year since I was there--oh ma!x94 and here Polly took up the thread that had been so rudely snapped; x93dont you think shes got ten of the prettiest--yes the sweetest little chickens you ever saw! Why cant we have some mammy?x94 x93Costs moneyx94 replied Mrs Pepper x93Weve got too many in the house to have any outsidex94 x93Oh dearx94 said Polly with a red face that was toasting about as much as the bread she was holding on the point of an old fork; x93we never have had anything Therex94 she added at last; x93thats the best I can do; now Ill put the butter on this little blue plate; aint that cunning ma?x94 x93Yesx94 said Mrs Pepper approvingly; x93it takes you Pollyx94 So Polly trotted first to Ben up the crooked low stairs to the loft; and while she regaled him with the brown toast and butter she kept her tongue flying on the subject of the little chicks and all that she saw on the famous Henderson visit Poor Ben pretended hard to eat but ate nothing really; and Polly saw it all and it cut her to the heart--so she talked faster than ever x93Nowx94 she said starting to go back to Phronsie; x93Ben Pepper just as soon as you get well well have some chickens--so there!x94 x93Guess we shant get em very soonx94 said Ben despondently x93if Ive got to lie here; and besides Polly you know every bit we can save has got to go for the new stovex94 x93Oh dearx94 said Polly x93I forgot that; so it has; seems to me everythings giving out!x94 x93You cant bake any longer in the old thingx94 said Ben turning over and looking at her; x93poor girl I dont see how youve stood it so longx94 x93And weve been stuffing itx94 cried Polly merrily x93till twont stuff any morex94 x93Nox94 said Ben turning back again x93thats all worn outx94 x93Well you must go to sleepx94 said Polly x93or mammyll be up here; and Phronsie hasnt had her breakfast eitherx94 Phronsie was wailing away dismally sitting up in the middle of the old bed Her face pricked she said and she was rubbing it vigorously with both fat little hands and then crying worse than ever x93Oh me! oh my!x94 cried Polly; x93how you look Phronsie!x94 x93I want my mammy!x94 cried poor Phronsie x93Mammy cant come now Phronsie dear; shes sewing See what Pollys got for you--butter isnt that splendid!x94 Phronsie stopped for just one moment and took a mouthful; but the toast was hard and dry and she cried harder than before x93Nowx94 said Polly curling up on the bed beside her x93if youll stop crying Phronsie Pepper Ill tell you about the cunningest yes the very cunningest little chickens you ever saw One was white and he looked just like thisx94 said Polly tumbling over on the bed in a heap; x93he couldnt stand up straight he was so fatx94 x93Did he bite?x94 asked Phronsie full of interest x93No he didnt bite mex94 said Polly; x93but his mother put a bug in his mouth--just as Im doing you knowx94 and she broke off a small piece of the toast put on a generous bit of butter and held it over Phronsies mouth x93Did he swallow it?x94 asked the child obediently opening her little red lips x93Oh snapped itx94 answered Polly x93quick as ever he could I tell you; but twasnt good like this Phronsiex94 x93Did he have two bugs?x94 asked Phronsie eying suspiciously the second morsel of dry toast that Polly was conveying to her mouth x93Well he would have hadx94 replied Polly x93if thered been bugs enough; but there were nine other chicks Phronsiex94 x93Poor chickiesx94 said Phronsie and looked lovingly at the rest of the toast and butter on the plate; and while Polly fed it to her listened with absorbed interest to all the particulars concerning each and every chick in the Henderson hen-coop x93Motherx94 said Polly towards evening x93Im going to sit up with Ben to-night; say I may do motherx94 x93Oh no you cantx94 replied Mrs Pepper; x93youll get worn out; and then what shall I do? Joel can hand him his medicinex94 x93Oh Joe would tumble to sleep mammyx94 said Polly x93the first thing--let mex94 x93Perhaps Phronsiell let me go to-nightx94 said Mrs Pepper reflectively x93Oh no she wont I knowx94 replied Polly decisively; x93she wants you all the timex94 x93I will Pollyx94 said Davie coming in with an armful of wood in time to hear the conversation x93Ill give him his medicine maynt I mammy?x94 and David let down his load and came over where his mother and Polly sat sewing to urge his rights x93I dont knowx94 said his mother smiling on him x93Can you do you think?x94 x93Yes maam!x94 said Davie straightening himself up When they told Ben he said he knew a better way than for Davie to watch; hed have a string tied to Davies arm and the end hed hold in bed and when twas time for medicine hed pull the string and that would wake Davie up! Polly didnt sleep much more on her shake-down on the floor than if she had watched with Ben; for Phronsie cried and moaned and wanted a drink of water every two minutes it seemed to her As she went back into her nest after one of these travels Polly thought x93Well I dont care if nobody else gets sick; if Benll only get well To-morrow Im goin to do mammys sack shes begun for Mr Jackson; its all plain sew-in just like a bag; and I can do it I know--x94 and so she fell into a troubled sleep only to be awakened by Phronsies fretful little voice x93I want a drink of water Polly I dox94 x93Dont she drink awfully mammy?x94 asked Polly after one of these excursions out to the kitchen after the necessary draught x93Yesx94 said Mrs Pepper; x93and she mustnt have any more; twill hurt herx94 But Phronsie fell into a delicious sleep after that and didnt want any more luckily x93Here Joex94 said Mrs Pepper the next morning x93take this coat up to Mr Peterses; and be sure you get the money for itx94 x93Howll I get it?x94 asked Joe who didnt relish the long hot walk x93Why tell em were sick--Bens sickx94 added Mrs Pepper as the most decisive thing; x93and we must have it; and then wait for itx94 x93Tisnt pleasant up at the Petersesx94 grumbled Joel taking the parcel and moving slowly off x93No no Pollyx94 said Mrs Pepper x93you neednt do thatx94 seeing Polly take up some sewing after doing up the room and finishing the semi-weekly bake; x93youre all beat out with that tussle over the stove; that sackll have to go till next weekx94 x93It cant mammyx94 said Polly snipping off a basting thread; x93weve got to have the money; how muchll he give you for it?x94 x93Thirty centsx94 replied Mrs Pepper x93Wellx94 said Polly x93weve got to get all the thirty centses we can mammy dear; and I know I can do it truly--try me oncex94 she implored x93Wellx94 Mrs Pepper relented slowly x93Dont feel bad mammy dearx94 comforted Polly sewing away briskly; x93Benll get well pretty soon and then well be all rightx94 x93Maybex94 said Mrs Pepper; and went back to Phronsie who could scarcely let her out of her sight Polly stitched away bravely x93Now if I do this good mammyll let me do it other timesx94 she said to herself Davie too worked patiently out of doors trying to do Bens chores The little fellow blundered over things that Ben would have accomplished in half the time and he had to sit down often on the steps of the little old shed where the tools were kept to wipe his hot face and rest x93Pollyx94 said Mrs Pepper x93hadnt you better stop a little? Dear me! how fast you sew child!x94 Polly gave a delighted little hum at her mothers evident approval x93Im going to do em all next week mammyx94 she said; x93then Mr Atkins wont take em away from us I guessx94 Mr Atkins kept the store and gave out coats and sacks of coarse linen and homespun to Mrs Pepper to make; and it was the fear of losing the work that had made the mothers heart sink x93I dont believe anybodys got such children as I havex94 she said; and she gave Polly a motherly little pat that the little daughter felt clear to the tips of her toes with a thrill of delight About half-past two long after dinner Joe came walking in hungry as a beaver but flushed and triumphant x93Why where have you been all this time?x94 asked his mother x93Oh Joe you didnt stop to play?x94 asked Polly from her perch where she sat sewing giving him a reproachful glance x93Stop to play!x94 retorted Joe indignantly; x93no I guess I didnt! Ive been to Old Petersesx94 x93Not all this time!x94 exclaimed Mrs Pepper x93Yes I have toox94 replied Joel sturdily marching up to her x93And theres your money mother;x94 and he counted out a quarter of a dollar in silver pieces and pennies which he took from a dingy wad of paper stowed away in the depths of his pocket x93Oh Joex94 said Mrs Pepper sinking back in her chair and looking at him; x93what do you mean?x94 Polly put her work in her lap and waited to hear x93Wheres my dinner Polly?x94 asked Joel; x93I hope its a big one x93Yes tisx94 said Polly; x93youve got lots to-day its in the corner of the cupboard covered up with the plate--so tell on Joex94 x93Thats elegant!x94 said Joel coming back with the well-filled plate Bens and his own share x93Do tell us Joeyx94 implored Polly; x93mothers waitingx94 x93Wellx94 said Joel his mouth half full x93I waited--and he said the coat was all right;--and--and--Mrs Peters said twas all right;--and Mirandy Peters said twas all right; but they didnt any of em say anythin about payin so I didnt think twas all right--and--and--cant I have some more butter Polly?x94 x93Nox94 said Polly sorry to refuse him hed been so good about the money; x93the butters got to be saved for Ben and Phronsiex94 x93Ohx94 said Joe x93I wish Miss Henderson would send us some more I do! I think she might!x94 x93For shame Joex94 said Mrs Pepper; x93she was very good to send this I think; now what else did you say?x94 she asked x93Wellx94 said Joel taking another mouthful of bread x93so I waited; you told me to mother you know--and they all went to work; and they didnt mind me at all and--there wasnt anything to look at so I sat--and sat--Polly cant I have some gingerbread?x94 x93Nox94 said Polly x93its all gone; I gave the last piece to Phronsie the day she was taken sickx94 x93Oh dearx94 said Joel x93everythings gonex94 x93Well do go on Joe dox94 x93And--then they had dinner; and Mr Peters said Hasnt that boy gone home yet? and Mrs Peters said no--and he called me in and asked me why I didnt run along home; and I said Phronsie was sick and Ben had the squeezles--x94 x93The what?x94 said Polly x93The squeezlesx94 repeated Joel irritably; x93thats what you saidx94 x93Its measles Joeyx94 corrected Mrs Pepper; x93never mind I wouldnt feel badx94 x93Well they all laughed and laughed and then I said you told me to wait till I did get the moneyx94 x93Oh Joex94 began Mrs Pepper x93you shouldnt have told em so--what did he say?x94 x93Well he laughed and said I was a smart boy and hed see; and Mirandy said do pay him pa he must be tired to death--and dont you think he went to a big desk in the corner and took out a box and twas full most of money--lots! oh! and he gave me mine--and--thats all; and Im tired to deathx94 And Joel flung himself down on the floor expanded his legs as only Joel could and took a comfortable roll x93So you must bex94 said Polly pityingly x93waiting at those Petersesx94 x93Dont ever want to see any more Petersesx94 said Joel; never never never! x93Oh dearx94 thought Polly as she sewed on into the afternoon x93I wonder what does all my eyes! feels just like sand in em;x94 and she rubbed and rubbed to thread her needle But she was afraid her mother would see so she kept at her sewing Once in awhile the bad feeling would go away and then she would forget all about it x93There now who says I cant do it! thats most donex94 she cried jumping up and spinning across the room to stretch herself a bit x93and to-morrow Ill finish itx94 x93Wellx94 said Mrs Pepper x93if you can do that Polly youll be the greatest help Ive had yetx94 So Polly tucked herself into the old shake-down with a thankful heart that night hoping for morning Alas! when morning did come Polly could hardly move The measles! what should she do! A faint hope of driving them off made her tumble out of bed and stagger across the room to look in the old cracked looking-glass All hope was gone as the red reflection met her gaze Polly was on the sick list now! x93I wont be sickx94 she said; x93at any rate Ill keep aroundx94 An awful feeling made her clutch the back of a chair but she managed somehow to get into her clothes and go groping blindly into the kitchen Somehow Polly couldnt see very well She tried to set the table but twas no use x93Oh dearx94 she thought x93whateverll mammy do?x94 x93Hulloa!x94 said Joel coming in x93whats the matter Polly?x94 Polly started at his sudden entrance and wavering a minute fell over in a heap x93Oh ma!

oh! please dont!x94 x93Hey!x94 said the doctor; and he looked kindly at the small object with a very red face in the middle of the bed Then he added gently x93Were going to make Polly well little girl; so that she can see splendidlyx94 x93Will you really?x94 asked the child doubtfully x93Yesx94 said the doctor; x93well try hard; and you mustnt cry; cause then Pollyll cry and that will make her eyes very bad; very bad indeedx94 he repeated impressively x93I wont cryx94 said Phronsie; x93no not one bitx94 And she wiped off the last tear with her fat little hand and watched to see what next was to be done And Polly was left very rebellious indeed in the big bed with a cooling lotion on the poor eyes that somehow didnt cool them one bit x93If twas anythin but my eyes mammy I could stand itx94 she bewailed flouncing over and over in her impatience; x93and wholl do all the work now?x94 x93Dont think of the work Pollyx94 said Mrs Pepper x93I cant do anything but thinkx94 said poor Polly Just at that moment a queer noise out in the kitchen was heard x93Do go out mother and see what tisx94 said Polly x93Ive comex94 said a cracked voice close up by the bedroom door followed by a big black cap which could belong to no other than Grandma Bascom x93to set by you a spell; whats the matter?x94 she asked and stopped amazed to see Polly in bed x93Oh Pollys takenx94 screamed Mrs Pepper in her ear x93Taken!x94 repeated the old lady x93what is it--a fit?x94 x93Nox94 said Mrs Pepper; x93the same as Bens got; and Phronsie; the measlesx94 x93The measles has she?x94 said grandma; x93well thats bad; and Bens away you sayx94 x93No he isnt eitherx94 screamed Mrs Pepper x93hes got them too!x94 x93Got two what?x94 asked grandma x93Measles!

Deary! how we look!x94 x93Never mind mammyx94 called back Polly longing to spring out of bed and fix up a bit x93Im sorry to hear the children are sickx94 said Mrs Henderson coming in in her sweet gentle way x93We didnt know itx94 said the minister x93until this morning--can we see them?x94 x93Oh yes sirx94 said Mrs Pepper; x93Bens upstairs; and Polly and Phronsie are in herex94 x93Poor little things!x94 said Mrs Henderson compassionately; x93hadnt you betterx94 turning to the minister x93go up and see Ben first while I will visit the little girls?x94 So the minister mounted the crooked stairs; and Mrs Henderson went straight up to Pollys side; and the first thing Polly knew a cool gentle hand was laid on her hot head and a voice said x93Ive come to see my little chicken now!x94 x93Oh maamx94 said Polly bursting into a sob x93I dont care about my eyes--only mammy--x94 and she broke right down x93I knowx94 said the ministers wife soothingly; x93but its for you to bear patiently Polly--what do you suppose the chicks were doing when I came away?x94 And Mrs Henderson while she held Pollys hand smiled and nodded encouragingly to Phronsie who was staring at her from the other side of the bed x93I dont know maamx94 said Polly; x93please tell usx94 x93Well they were all fighting over a grasshopper--yes ten of themx94 x93Which one got it?x94 asked Polly in intense interest; x93oh!

I declare!x94 x93My own!x94 cried Phronsie sticking out one foot for inspection where every button was in the wrong button-hole x93and theyve got red tops too!x94 x93So they havex94 said the doctor getting down on the floor beside her; x93beautiful red tops arent they?x94 x93Be-yew-ti-fulx94 sang the child delightedly x93Does Polly have new shoes every day?x94 asked the doctor in a low voice pretending to examine the other foot Phronsie opened her eyes very wide at this x93Oh no she dont have anything Polly dontx94 x93And what does Polly want most of all--do you know? see if you can tell mex94 And the doctor put on the most alluring expression that he could muster x93Oh I know!x94 cried Phronsie with a very wise look x93There nowx94 cried the doctor x93youre the girl for me! to think you know! so what is it?x94 Phronsie got up very gravely and with one shoe half on she leaned over and whispered in the doctors ear x93A stove!x94 x93A what?x94 said the doctor looking at her and then at the old black thing in the corner that looked as if it were ashamed of itself; x93why shes got onex94 x93Ohx94 said the child x93it wont burn; and sometimes Polly cries she does when shes all alone--and I see herx94 x93Nowx94 said the doctor very sympathetically x93thats too bad; that is! and then what does she do?x94 x93Oh Ben stuffs it upx94 said the child laughing; x93and so does Polly too with paper; and then it all tumbles out quick; oh! just as quick!x94 And Phronsie shook her yellow head at the dismal remembrance x93Do you supposex94 said the doctor getting up x93that you know of any smart little girl around here about four years old and that knows how to button on her own red-topped shoes that would like to go to ride to-morrow morning in my carriage with me? x93Oh I do!x94 cried Phronsie hopping on one toe; x93its me!x94 x93Very well thenx94 said Dr Fisher going to the bedroom door x93well lookout for to-morrow thenx94 To poor Polly lying in the darkened room or sitting up in the big rocking-chair--for Polly wasnt really very sick in other respects the disease having all gone into the merry brown eyes--the time seemed interminable Not to do anything! The very idea at any time would have filled her active wide-awake little body with horror; and now here she was! x93Oh dear I cant bear it!x94 she said when she knew by the noise in the kitchen that everybody was out there; so nobody heard except a fat old black spider in the corner and he didnt tell anyone! x93I know its a weekx94 she said x93since dinnertime! If Ben were only well to talk to mex94 x93Oh I say Pollyx94 screamed Joel at that moment running in x93Bens a-comin down the stairs!x94 x93Stop Joex94 said Mrs Pepper; x93you shouldnt have told; he wanted to surprise Pollyx94 x93Oh is he!x94 cried Polly clasping her hands in rapture; x93mammy cant I take off this horrid bandage and see him?x94 x93Dear me no!x94 said Mrs Pepper springing forward; x93not for the world Polly!

Ben made him!x94 x93Have you!x94 said Mrs Pepper taking off her shawl and laying her parcel of work down on the table x93now thats nice!x94 x93Oh mammy!x94 cried Polly x93it does seem so good to be all together again!x94 x93And I thank the Lord!x94 said Mrs Pepper looking down on her happy little group; and the tears were in her eyes--x93and children we ought to be very good and please Him for Hes been so good to usx94 THE CLOUD OVER THE LITTLE BROWN HOUSE When Phronsie with many crows of delight and much chattering had gotten fairly started the following morning on her much-anticipated drive with the doctor the whole family excepting Polly drawn up around the door to see them off Mrs Pepper resolved to snatch the time and run down for an hour or two to one of her customers who had long been waiting for a little x93tailoringx94 to be done for her boys x93Now Joelx94 she said putting on her bonnet before the cracked looking-glass x93you stay along of Polly; Ben must go up to bed the doctor said; and Davies going to the store for some molasses; so you and Polly must keep housex94 x93Yesmx94 said Joel; x93may I have somethin to eat ma?x94 x93Yesx94 said Mrs Pepper; x93but dont you eat the new bread; you may have as much as you want of the oldx94 x93Isnt there any molasses mammy?x94 asked Joel as she bade Polly good-bye! and gave her numberless charges x93to be careful of your eyesx94 and x93not to let a crack of light in through the curtainx94 as the old green paper shade was called x93No; if youre very hungry you can eat breadx94 said Mrs Pepper sensibly x93Joelx94 said Polly after the mother had gone x93I do wish you could read to mex94 x93Well I cantx94 said Joel glad he didnt know how; x93I thought the minister was cominx94 x93Well he wasx94 said Polly x93but mammy said he had to go out of town to a consequencex94 x93A what!x94 asked Joel very much impressed x93A con--x94 repeated Polly x93Well it began with a con--and I am sure--yes very sure it was consequencex94 x93That must be splendidx94 said Joel coming up to her chair and slowly drawing a string he held in his hand back and forth x93to go to consequences and everything! When Im a man Polly Pepper Im going to be a minister and have a nice time and go--just everywhere!x94 x93Oh Joel!x94 exclaimed Polly quite shocked; x93you couldnt be one; you arent good enoughx94 x93I dont carex94 said Joel not at all dashed by her plainness x93Ill be good then--when Im a big man; dont you suppose Pollyx94 as a new idea struck him x93that Mr Henderson ever is naughty?x94 x93Nox94 said Polly very decidedly; x93never never never!x94 x93Then I dont want to be onex94 said Joel veering round with a sigh of relief x93and besides Id rather have a pair of horses like Mr Slocums and then I could go everywheres I guess!x94 x93And sell tin?x94 asked Polly x93just like Mr Slocum?x94 x93Yesx94 said Joel; x93this is the way Id go--Gee-whop! gee-whoa!x94 and Joel pranced with his imaginary steeds all around the room making about as much noise as any other four boys as he brought up occasionally against the four-poster or the high old bureau x93Well!x94 said a voice close up by Pollys chair that made her skip with apprehension it was so like Miss Jerusha Hendersons--Joel was whooping away behind the bedstead to his horses that had become seriously entangled so he didnt hear anything But when Polly said bashfully x93I cant see anything maamx94 he came up red and shining to the surface and stared with all his might x93I came to see you little girlx94 said Miss Jerusha severely seating herself stiffly by Pollys side x93Thank you maamx94 said Polly faintly x93Whos this boy?x94 asked the lady turning around squarely on Joel and eying him from head to foot x93Hes my brother Joelx94 said Polly Joel still stared x93Which brother?x94 pursued Miss Jerusha like a census-taker x93He is next to mex94 said Polly wishing her mother was home; x93hes nine Joel isx94 x93Hes big enough to do something to help his motherx94 said Miss Jerusha looking him through and through x93Dont you think you might do something when the others are sick and your poor mother is working so hard?x94 she continued in a cold voice x93I do somethingx94 blurted out Joel sturdily x93lots and lots!x94 x93You shouldnt say lotsx94 reproved Miss Jerusha with a sharp look over her spectacles x93tisnt proper for boys to talk so; what do you do all day long?x94 she asked turning back to Polly after a withering glance at Joel who still stared x93I cant do anything maamx94 replied Polly sadly x93I cant see to do anythingx94 x93Well you might knit I should thinkx94 said her visitor x93its dreadful for a girl as big as you are to sit all day idle; I had sore eyes once when I was a little girl--how old are you?x94 she asked abruptly x93Eleven last monthx94 said Polly x93Well I wasnt only nine when I knit a stocking; and I had sore eyes too; you see I was a very little girl and--x94 x93Was you ever little?x94 interrupted Joel in extreme incredulity drawing near and looking over the big square figure x93Hey?x94 said Miss Jerusha; so Joel repeated his question before Polly could stop him x93Of coursex94 answered Miss Jerusha; and then she added tartly x93little boys shouldnt speak unless theyre spoken to Nowx94 and she turned back to Polly again x93didnt you ever knit a stocking?x94 x93No maamx94 said Polly x93not a whole onex94 x93Dear me!x94 exclaimed Miss Jerusha; x93did I ever!x94 And she raised her black mitts in intense disdain x93A big girl like you never to knit a stocking! to think your mother should bring you up so! and--x94 x93She didnt bring us upx94 screamed Joel in indignation facing her with blazing eyes x93Joelx94 said Polly x93be stillx94 x93And youre very impertinent toox94 said Miss Jerusha; x93a good child never is impertinentx94 Polly sat quite still; and Miss Jerusha continued x93Now I hope you will learn to be industrious; and when I come again I will see what you have donex94 x93You arent ever coming againx94 said Joel defiantly; x93no never!x94 x93Joel!x94 implored Polly and in her distress she pulled up her bandage as she looked at him; x93you know mammyll be so sorry at you! Oh maam andx94 she turned to Miss Jerusha who was now thoroughly aroused to the duty she saw before her of doing these children good x93I dont know what is the reason maam; Joel never talks so; hes real good; and--x94 x93It only showsx94 said the lady seeing her way quite clear for a little exhortation x93that youve all had your own way from infancy; and that you dont do what you might to make your mothers life a happy onex94 x93Oh maamx94 cried Polly and she burst into a flood of tears x93please please dont say that!x94 x93And I sayx94 screamed Joel stamping his small foot x93if you make Polly cry youll kill her! Dont Polly dont!x94 and the boy put both arms around her neck and soothed and comforted her in every way he could think of And Miss Jerusha seeing no way to make herself heard disappeared feeling pity for children who would turn away from good advice But still Polly cried on; all the pent-up feelings that had been so long controlled had free vent now She really couldnt stop! Joel frightened to death at last said x93Im going to wake up Benx94 That brought Polly to; and she sobbed out x93Oh no Jo--ey--Ill stopx94 x93I willx94 said Joel seeing his advantage; x93Im going Pollyx94 and he started to the foot of the stairs x93No Im done now Joex94 said Polly wiping her eyes and choking back her thoughts--x93oh Joe! I must scream! my eyes aches so!x94 and poor Polly fairly writhed all over the chair x93Whatll I do?x94 said Joel at his wits end running back x93do you want some water?x94 x93Oh nox94 gasped Polly; x93doctor wouldnt let me; oh! I wish mammyd come!x94 x93Ill go and look for herx94 suggested Joel feeling as if he must do something; and hed rather be out at the gate than to see Polly suffer x93That wont bring herx94 said Polly; trying to keep still; x93Ill try to waitx94 x93Here she is now!x94 cried Joel peeping out of the window; x93oh! goody!x94 JOELS TURN x93Wellx94 Mrs Peppers tone was unusually blithe as she stepped into the kitchen--x93youve had a nice time I suppose--what in the world!x94 and she stopped at the bedroom door x93Oh mammy if youd been here!x94 said Joel while Polly sat still only holding on to her eyes as if they were going to fly out; x93theres been a big woman here; she came right in--and she talked awfully! and Pollys been a-cryin and her eyes ache dreadfully--and--x94 x93Been crying!x94 repeated Mrs Pepper coming up to poor Polly x93Polly been crying!x94 she still repeated x93Oh mammy I couldnt help itx94 said Polly; x93she said--x94 and in spite of all she could do the rain of tears began again which bade fair to be as uncontrolled as before But Mrs Pepper took her up firmly in her arms as if she were Phronsie and sat down in the old rocking-chair and just patted her back x93There therex94 she whispered soothingly x93dont think of it Polly; mothers got homex94 x93Oh mammyx94 said Polly crawling up to the comfortable neck for protection x93I ought not to mind; but twas Miss Jerusha Henderson; and she said--x94 x93What did she say?x94 asked Mrs Pepper thinking perhaps it to be the wiser thing to let Polly free her mind x93Oh she said that we ought to be doing something; and I ought to knit and--x94 x93Go onx94 said her mother x93And then Joel got naughty; oh mammy he never did so before; and I couldnt stop himx94 cried Polly in great distress; x93I really couldnt mammy--and he talked to her; and he told her she wasnt ever coming here againx94 x93Joel shouldnt have said thatx94 said Mrs Pepper and under her breath something was added that Polly even failed to hear--x93but no more she isnt!x94 x93And mammyx94 cried Polly--and she flung her arms around her mothers neck and gave her a grasp that nearly choked Mrs Pepper x93aint I helpin you some mammy? Oh! I wish I could do something big for you? Aint you happy mammy?x94 x93For the lands sakes!x94 cried Mrs Pepper straining Polly to her heart x93whatever has that woman--whatever could she have said to you? Such a girl as you are too!x94 cried Mrs Pepper hugging Polly and covering her with kisses so tender that Polly warmed and cuddled up to her hearts content was comforted to the full x93Wellx94 said Mrs Pepper when at last she thought she had formed between Polly and Joel about the right idea of the visit x93well now we wont think of it ever any more; tisnt worth it Polly you knowx94 But poor Polly! and poor mother! They both were obliged to think of it Nothing could avert the suffering of the next few days caused by that long flow of burning tears x93Nothing feels good on em mammyx94 said Polly at last twisting her hands in the vain attempt to keep from rubbing the aching inflamed eyes that drove her nearly wild with their itching x93there isnt any use in trying anythingx94 x93There will be usex94 energetically protested Mrs Pepper bringing another cool bandage x93as long as youve got an eye in your head Polly Pepper!x94 Dr Fishers face when he first saw the change that the fateful visit had wrought and heard the accounts was very grave indeed Everything had been so encouraging on his last visit that he had come very near promising Polly speedy freedom from the hateful bandage But the little Pepper household soon had something else to think of more important even than Pollys eyes for now the heartiest the jolliest of all the little group was down--Joel How he fell sick they scarcely knew it all came so suddenly The poor bewildered family had hardly time to think before delirium and perhaps death stared them in the face When Polly first heard it by Phronsies pattering downstairs and screaming x93Oh Polly Joeys dre-ad-ful sick he is!x94 she jumped right up and tore off the bandage x93Now I will help mother! I will so there!x94 and in another minute she would have been up in the sick room But the first thing she knew a gentle but firm hand was laid upon hers; and she found herself back again in the old rocking-chair and listening to the Doctors words which were quite stern and decisive x93Now I tell youx94 he said x93you must not take off that bandage again; do you know the consequences? You will be blind! and then you will be a care to your mother all your life!x94 x93I shall be blind anywayx94 said Polly despairingly; x93so twont make any differencex94 x93No; your eyes will come out of it all right only I did hopex94 and the good doctors face fell--x93that the other two boys would escape; butx94 and he brightened up at sight of Pollys forlorn visage--x93see you do your part by keeping stillx94 But there came a day soon when everything was still around the once happy little brown house--when only whispers were heard from white lips; and thoughts were fearfully left unuttered On the morning of one of these days when Mrs Pepper felt she could not exist an hour longer without sleep kind Mrs Beebe came to stay until things were either better or worse Still the cloud hovered dark and forbidding At last one afternoon when Polly was all alone she could endure it no longer She flung herself down by the side of the old bed and buried her face in the gay patched bed-quilt x93Dear Godx94 she said x93make me willing to have anythingx94 she hesitated--x93yes anything happen; to be blind forever and to have Joey sick only make me goodx94 How long she staid there she never knew; for she fell asleep--the first sleep she had had since Joey was taken sick And little Mrs Beebe coming in found her thus x93Pollyx94 the good woman said leaning over her x93you poor pretty creeter you; Im goin to tell you somethin--there there just to think! Joels goin to get well!x94 x93Oh Mrs Beebe!x94 cried Polly tumbling over in a heap on the floor her face as much as could be seen under the bandage in a perfect glow x93Is he really?x94 x93Yes to be sure; the dangers all over nowx94 said the little old lady inwardly thinking--x93If I hadnt a-come!x94 x93Well then the Lord wants him tox94 cried Polly in rapture; x93dont he Mrs Beebe?x94 x93To be sure--to be surex94 repeated the kind friend only half understanding x93Well I dont care about my eyes thenx94 cried Polly; and to Mrs Beebes intense astonishment and dismay she spun round and round in the middle of the floor x93Oh Polly Polly!x94 the little old lady cried running up to her x93do stop! the doctor wouldnt let you! he wouldnt really you know! itll all go to your eyesx94 x93I dont carex94 repeated Polly in the middle of a spin; but she stopped obediently; x93seems as if I just as soon be blind as not; its so beautiful Joeys going to get well!x94 SUNSHINE AGAIN But as Joel was smitten down suddenly so he came up quickly and his hearty nature asserted itself by rapid strides toward returning health; and one morning he astonished them all by turning over suddenly and exclaiming x93I want something to eat!x94 x93Bless the Lord!x94 cried Mrs Pepper x93now hes going to live!x94 x93But he mustnt eatx94 protested Mrs Beebe in great alarm trotting for the cup of gruel x93Here you pretty creeter you heres something nicex94 And she temptingly held the spoon over Joels mouth; but with a grimace he turned away x93Oh I want something to eat! some gingerbread or some bread and butterx94 x93Dear me!x94 ejaculated Mrs Beebe x93Gingerbread!x94 Poor Mrs Pepper saw the hardest part of her trouble now before her as she realized that the returning appetite must be fed only on strengthening food; for where it was to come from she couldnt tell x93The Lord only knows where well get itx94 she groaned within herself Yes He knew A rap at the door and little David ran down to find the cause x93Oh mammyx94 he said x93Mrs Henderson sent it--see! see!x94 And in the greatest excitement he placed in her lap a basket that smelt savory and nice even before it was opened When it was opened there lay a little bird delicately roasted and folded in a clean napkin; also a glass of jelly crimson and clear x93Oh Joeyx94 cried Mrs Pepper almost overwhelmed with joy x93see what Mrs Henderson sent you! now you can eat fit for a king!x94 That little bird certainly performed its mission in life; for as Mrs Beebe said x93It just touched the spot!x94 and from that very moment Joel improved so rapidly they could hardly believe their eyes x93Hoh! I havent been sick!x94 he cried on the third day true to his nature x93Mammy I want to get upx94 x93Oh dear no! you mustnt Joelx94 cried Mrs Pepper in a fright running up to him as he was preparing to give the bedclothes a lusty kick; x93youll send em inx94 x93Send what in?x94 asked Joel looking up at his mother in terror as the dreadful thought made him pause x93Why the measles Joey; theyll all go in if you get outx94 x93How they goin to get in again Id like to know?x94 asked Joel looking at the little red spots on his hands in incredulity; say ma! x93Well they willx94 said his mother x93as youll find to your sorrow if you get out of bedx94 x93Oh dearx94 said Joel beginning to whimper as he drew into bed again x93when can I get up mammy!x94 x93Oh in a day or twox94 responded Mrs Pepper cheerfully; x93youre getting on so finely youll be as smart as a cricket! Shouldnt you say he might get up in a day or two Mrs Beebe?x94 she appealed to that individual who was knitting away cheerily in the corner x93Well if he keeps on as hes begun I shouldnt know what to thinkx94 replied Mrs Beebe x93It beats all how quick hes picked up I never see anything like it Im sure!x94 And as Mrs Beebe was a great authority in sickness the old sunny cheeriness began to creep into the brown house once more and to bubble over as of yore x93Seems as if twas just good to livex94 said Mrs Pepper thankfully once when her thoughts were too much for her x93I dont believe I shall ever care how poor we arex94 she continued x93as long as were togetherx94 x93And thats just what the Lord meant maybex94 replied good Mrs Beebe who was preparing to go home Joel kept the house in a perfect uproar all through his getting well Mrs Pepper observed one day when he had been more turbulent than usual that she was x93almost worn to a threadx94 x93Twasnt anything to take care of you Joex94 she added x93when you were real sick because then I knew where you were; but--well you wont ever have the measles again I spose and thats some comfort!x94 Little David who had been nearly stunned by the sickness that had laid aside his almost constant companion could express his satisfaction and joy in no other way than by running every third minute and begging to do something for him And Joel who loved dearly to be waited on improved every opportunity that offered; which Mrs Pepper observing soon put a stop to x93Youll run his legs off Joelx94 at last she said when he sent David the third time down to the wood-pile for a stick of just the exact thickness and which the little messenger declared wasnt to be found x93Havent you any mercy? Youve kept him going all day toox94 she added glancing at Davids pale face x93Oh mammyx94 panted David x93dont; I love to go Here Joe is the best I could findx94 handing him a nice smooth stick x93I know you dox94 said his mother; x93but Joes getting better now and he must learn to spare youx94 x93I dont want to spare folksx94 grumbled Joel whittling away with energy; x93Ive been sick--real sickx94 he added lifting his chubby face to his mother to impress the fact x93I know you havex94 she cried running to kiss her boy; x93but now Joe youre most well To-morrow Im going to let you go down-stairs; what do you think of that!x94 x93Hooray!x94 screamed Joel throwing away the stick and clapping his hands forgetting all about his serious illness x93thatll be prime!x94 x93Arent you too sick to go Joey?x94 asked Mrs Pepper mischievously x93No Im not sickx94 cried Joel in the greatest alarm fearful his mother meant to take back the promise; x93Ive never been sick Oh mammy! you know youll let me go wont your?x94 x93I guess sox94 laughed his mother x93Come on Phronx94 cried Joel giving her a whirl David who was too tired for active sport sat on the floor and watched them frolic in great delight x93Mammyx94 said he edging up to her side as the sport went on x93do you know I think its just good--its--oh its so frisky since Joe got well isnt it mammy?x94 x93Yes indeedx94 said Mrs Pepper giving him a radiant look in return for his; x93and when Pollys around again with her two eyes all right--well I dont know what we shall do I declare!x94 x93Boo!x94 cried a voice next morning close to Pollys elbow unmistakably Joels x93Oh Joel Pepper!x94 she cried whirling around x93is that really you!x94 x93Yesx94 cried that individual confidently x93its I; oh I say Polly Ive had fun up-stairs I tell you what!x94 x93Poor boy!x94 said Polly compassionately x93I wasnt a poor boyx94 cried Joel indignantly; x93I had splendid things to eat; oh my!x94 and he closed one eye and smacked his lips in the delightful memory x93I know itx94 said Polly x93and Im so glad Joelx94 x93I dont suppose Ill ever get so many againx94 observed Joel reflectively after a minutes pause as one and another of the wondrous delicacies rose before his minds eye; x93not unless I have the measles again--say Polly cant I have em again?x94 x93Mercy no!x94 cried Polly in intense alarm x93I hope notx94 x93Well I dontx94 said Joel x93I wish I could have em sixty--no--two hundred times so there!x94 x93Well mammy couldnt take care of youx94 said Ben; x93you dont know what youre sayin Joex94 x93Well then I wish I could have the things without the measlesx94 said Joel willing to accommodate; x93only folks wont send emx94 he added in an injured tone x93Pollys had the hardest time of allx94 said her mother affectionately patting the bandage x93I think so toox94 put in Ben; x93if my eyes were hurt Id give upx94 x93So would Ix94 said David; and Joel to be in the fashion cried also x93I know I would;x94 while little Phronsie squeezed up to Pollys side x93And I toox94 x93Would what Puss?x94 asked Ben tossing her up high x93Have good thingsx94 cried the child in delight at understanding the others x93I would really Benx94 she cried gravely when they all screamed x93Well I hope sox94 said Ben tossing her higher yet x93Dont laugh at her boysx94 put in Polly; x93were all going to have good times now Phronsie now weve got wellx94 x93Yesx94 laughed the child from her high perch; x93we arent ever goin to be sick again ever--any morex94 she added impressively The good times were coming for Polly--coming pretty near and she didnt know it! All the children were in the secret; for as Mrs Pepper declared x93Theyd have to know it; and if they were let into the secret theyd keep it betterx94 So they had individually and collectively been intrusted with the precious secret and charged with the extreme importance of x93never letting any one knowx94 and they had been nearly bursting ever since with the wild desire to impart their knowledge x93Im afraid I shall tellx94 said David running to his mother at last; x93oh mammy I dont dare stay near Polly I do want to tell so badx94 x93Oh no you wont Davidx94 said his mother encouragingly x93when you know mother dont want you to; and besides think how Pollyll look when she sees itx94 x93I knowx94 cried David in the greatest rapture x93I wouldnt tell for all the world! I guess shell look nice dont you mother?x94 and he laughed in glee at the thought x93Poor child! I guess she will!x94 and then Mrs Pepper laughed too till the little old kitchen rang with delight at the accustomed sound The children all had to play x93clap in and clap outx94 in the bedroom while it came; and x93stage coachx94 too--x93anything to make a noisex94 Ben said And then after they got nicely started in the game he would be missing to help about the mysterious thing in the kitchen which was safe since Polly couldnt see him go on account of her bandage So she didnt suspect in the least And although the rest were almost dying to be out in the kitchen they conscientiously stuck to their bargain to keep Polly occupied Only Joel would open the door and peep once; and then Phronsie behind him began x93Oh I see the sto----x94 but David swooped down on her in a twinkling and smothered the rest by tickling her Once they came very near having the whole thing pop out x93Whatever is that noise in the kitchen?x94 asked Polly as they all stopped to take breath after the scuffle of x93stage coachx94 x93It sounds just like gratingx94 x93Ill go and seex94 cried Joel promptly; and then he flew out where his mother and Ben and two men were at work on a big black thing in the corner The old stove strange to say was nowhere to be seen! Something else stood in its place a shiny black affair with a generous supply of oven doors and altogether such a comfortable home-like look about it as if it would say--x93Im going to make sunshine in this house!x94 x93Oh Joelx94 cried his mother turning around on him with very black hands x93you havent told!x94 x93Nox94 said Joel x93but shes hearin the noise Polly isx94 x93Hush!x94 said Ben to one of the men x93We cant put it up without some noisex94 the man replied x93but well be as still as we canx94 x93Isnt it a big one ma?x94 asked Joel in the loudest of stage whispers that Polly on the other side of the door couldnt have failed to hear if Phronsie hadnt laughed just then x93Go back Joe dox94 said Ben x93play tag--anythingx94 he implored x93well be through in a few minutesx94 x93It takes forever!x94 said Joel disappearing within the bedroom door Luckily for the secret Phronsie just then ran a pin sticking up on the arm of the old chair into her finger; and Polly while comforting her forgot to question Joel And then the mother came in and though she had ill-concealed hilarity in her voice she kept chattering and bustling around with Pollys supper to such an extent that there was no chance for a word to be got in Next morning it seemed as if the x93little brown housex94 would turn inside out with joy x93Oh mammy!x94 cried Polly jumping into her arms the first thing as Dr Fisher untied the bandage x93my eyes are new! just the same as if Id just got em! Dont they look different?x94 she asked earnestly running to the cracked glass to see for herself x93Nox94 said Ben x93I hope not; the same brown ones Pollyx94 x93Wellx94 said Polly hugging first one and then another x93everybody looks different through them anywayx94 x93Ohx94 cried Joel x93come out into the kitchen Polly; its a great deal better out therex94 x93May I?x94 asked Polly who was in such a twitter looking at everything that she didnt know which way to turn x93Yesx94 said the doctor smiling at her x93Well thenx94 sang Polly x93come mammy well go first; isnt it just lovely--oh MAMMY!x94 and Polly turned so very pale and looked as if she were going to tumble right over that Mrs Pepper grasped her arm in dismay x93What is it?x94 she asked pointing to the corner while all the children stood round in the greatest excitement x93Whyx94 cried Phronsie x93its a stove--dont you know Polly?x94 But Polly gave one plunge across the room and before anybody could think she was down on her knees with her arms flung right around the big black thing and laughing and crying over it all in the same breath! And then they all took hold of hands and danced around it like wild little things; while Dr Fisher stole out silently--and Mrs Pepper laughed till she wiped her eyes to see them go x93We arent ever goin to have any more burnt breadx94 sang Polly all out of breath x93Nor your back isnt goin to break any morex94 panted Ben with a very red face x93Hooray!x94 screamed Joel and David to fill any pause that might occur while Phronsie gurgled and laughed at everything just as it came along And then they all danced and capered again; all but Polly who was down before the precious stove examining and exploring into ovens and everything that belonged to it x93Oh max94 she announced coming up to Mrs Pepper who had been obliged to fly to her sewing again and exhibiting a very crocky face and a pair of extremely smutty hands x93its most all ovens and its just splendid!x94 x93I know itx94 answered her mother delighted in the joy of her child x93My! how black you are Polly!x94 x93Oh I wishx94 cried Polly as the thought struck her x93that Dr Fisher could see it! Where did he go to ma?x94 x93I guess Dr Fisher has seen it beforex94 said Mrs Pepper and then she began to laugh x93You havent ever asked where the stove came from Pollyx94 And to be sure Polly had been so overwhelmed that if the stove had really dropped from the clouds it would have been small matter of astonishment to her as long as it had come; that was the main thing! x93Mammyx94 said Polly turning around slowly with the stove-lifter in her hand x93did Dr Fisher bring that stove?x94 x93He didnt exactly bring itx94 answered her mother x93but I guess he knew something about itx94 x93Oh hes the splendidest goodest man!x94 cried Polly x93that ever breathed! Did he really get us that stove?x94 x93Yesx94 said Mrs Pepper x93he would; I couldnt stop him I dont know how he found out you wanted one so bad; but he said it must be kept as a surprise when your eyes got wellx94 x93And he saved my eyes!x94 cried Polly full of gratitude x93Ive got a stove and two new eyes mammy just to think!x94 x93We ought to be good after all our merciesx94 said Mrs Pepper thankfully looking around on her little group Joel was engaged in the pleasing occupation of seeing how far he could run his head into the biggest oven and then pulling it out to exhibit its blackness thus engrossing the others in a perfect hubbub x93Im going to bake my doctor some little cakesx94 declared Polly when there was comparative quiet x93Do Pollyx94 cried Joel x93and then leave one or two overx94 x93Nox94 said Polly; x93we cant have any because these must be very nice Mammy cant I have some white on top just once?x94 she pleaded x93I dont knowx94 dubiously replied Mrs Pepper; x93eggs are dreadful dear and--x94 x93I dont carex94 said Polly recklessly; x93I must just once for Dr Fisherx94 x93I tell you Pollyx94 said Mrs Pepper x93what you might do; you might make him some little apple tarts--most every one likes them you knowx94 x93Wellx94 said Polly with a sigh x93I spose theyll have to do; but some time mammy Im going to bake him a big cake so there!x94 A THREATENED BLOW One day a few weeks after Mrs Pepper and Polly were busy in the kitchen Phronsie was out in the x93orchardx94 as the one scraggy apple-tree was called by courtesy singing her rag doll to sleep under its sheltering branches But x93Babyx94 was cross and wouldnt go to sleep and Phronsie was on the point of giving up and returning to the house when a strain of music made her pause with dolly in her apron There she stood with her finger in her mouth in utter astonishment wondering where the sweet sounds came from x93Oh Phronsie!x94 screamed Polly from the back door x93where are--oh here come quick! its the beau-ti-fullest!x94 x93What is it?x94 eagerly asked the little one hopping over the stubby grass leaving poor discarded x93Babyx94 on its snubby nose where it dropped in her hurry x93Oh a monkey!x94 cried Polly; x93do hurry! the sweetest little monkey you ever saw!x94 x93What is a monkey?x94 asked Phronsie skurrying after Polly to the gate where her mother was waiting for them x93Why a monkeys--a--monkeyx94 explained Polly x93I dont know any bettern that Here he is! Isnt he splendid!x94 and she lifted Phronsie up to the big post where she could see finely x93O-oh! ow!x94 screamed little Phronsie x93see him Polly! just see him!x94 A man with an organ was standing in the middle of the road playing away with all his might and at the end of a long rope was a lively little monkey in a bright red coat and a smart cocked hat The little creature pulled off his hat and with one long jump coming on the fence he made Phronsie a most magnificent bow Strange to say the child wasnt in the least frightened but put out her little fat hand speaking in gentle tones x93Poor little monkey! come here poor little monkey!x94 Turning up his little wrinkled face and glancing fearfully at his master Jocko began to grimace and beg for something to eat The man pulled the string and struck up a merry tune and in a minute the monkey spun around and around at such a lively pace and put in so many queer antics that the little audience were fairly convulsed with laughter x93I cant pay youx94 said Mrs Pepper wiping her eyes when at last the man pulled up the strap whistling to Jocko to jump up x93but Ill give you something to eat; and the monkey too he shall have something for his pains in amusing my childrenx94 The man looked very cross when she brought him out only brown bread and two cold potatoes x93Havent you got nothin bettern that?x94 x93Its as good as we havex94 answered Mrs Pepper The man threw down the bread in the road But Jocko thankfully ate his share Polly and Phronsie busily feeding him; and then he turned and snapped up the portion his master had left in the dusty road Then they moved on Mrs Pepper and Polly going back to their work in the kitchen A little down the road the man struck up another tune Phronsie who had started merrily to tell x93Babyx94 all about it stopped a minute to hear and--she didnt go back to the orchard! About two hours after Polly said merrily x93Im going to call Phronsie in mammy; she must be awfully tired and hungry by this timex94 She sang gayly on the way x93Im coming Phronsie coming--why where!--x94 peeping under the tree x93Babyx94 lay on its face disconsolately on the ground--and the orchard was empty! Phronsie was gone! x93Its no usex94 said Ben to the distracted household and such of the neighbors as the news had brought hurriedly to the scene x93to look any more around here--but somebody must go toward Hingham; hed be likely to go that wayx94 x93No one could tell where he would gox94 cried Polly wringing her hands x93But hed change Ben if he thought folks would think hed gone therex94 said Mrs Pepper x93We must go all roadsx94 said Ben firmly; x93one must take the stage to Boxville and Ill take Deacon Browns wagon on the Hingham road and somebody else must go to Toad Hollowx94 x93Ill go in the stagex94 screamed Joel who could scarcely see out of his eyes he had cried so; x93Ill find--find her--I know x93Be spry then Joe and catch it at the corner!x94 Everybody soon knew that little Phronsie Pepper had gone off with x93a cross organ man and an awful monkey!x94 and in the course of an hour dozens of people were out on the hot dusty roads in search x93Whats the matter?x94 asked a testy old gentleman in the stage of Joel who in his anxiety to see both sides of the road at once bobbed the old gentleman in the face so often as the stage lurched that at last he knocked his hat over his eyes x93My sisters gone off with a monkeyx94 explained Joel bobbing over to the other side as he thought he caught sight of something pink that he felt sure must be Phronsies apron x93Stop! stop! there she is!x94 he roared and the driver who had his instructions and was fully in sympathy pulled up so suddenly that the old gentleman flew over into the opposite seat x93Where?x94 But when they got up to it Joel saw that it was only a bit of pink calico flapping on a clothes-line; so he climbed back and away they rumbled again The others were having the same luck No trace could be found of the child To Ben who took the Hingham road the minutes seemed like hours x93I wont go backx94 he muttered x93until I take her I cant see mothers face!x94 But the ten miles were nearly traversed; almost the last hope was gone Into every thicket and lurking place by the road-side had he peered--but no Phronsie! Deacon Browns horse began to lag x93Go on!x94 said Ben hoarsely; x93oh dear Lord make me find her!x94 The hot sun poured down on the boys face and he had no cap What cared he for that? On and on he went Suddenly the horse stopped Ben doubled up the reins to give him a cut when x93WHOA!x94 he roared so loud that the horse in very astonishment gave a lurch that nearly flung him headlong But he was over the wheel in a twinkling and up with a bound to a small thicket of scrubby bushes on a high hill by the road-side Here lay a little bundle on the ground and close by it a big black dog; and over the whole standing guard was a boy a little bigger than Ben with honest gray eyes And the bundle was Phronsie! x93Dont wake her upx94 said the boy warningly as Ben with a hungry look in his eyes leaped up the hill x93shes tired to death!x94 x93Shes my sister!x94 cried Ben x93our Phronsie!x94 x93I know itx94 said the boy kindly; x93but I wouldnt wake her up yet if I were you Ill tell you all about itx94 and he took Bens hand which was as cold as ice SAFE x93Its all right Princex94 the boy added encouragingly to the big dog who lifting his noble head had turned two big eyes steadily on Ben x93Hes all right! lie down again!x94 Then flinging himself down on the grass he told Ben how he came to rescue Phronsie x93Prince and I were out for a strollx94 said he x93I live over in Hinghamx94 pointing to the pretty little town just a short distance before them in the hollow; x93that isx94 laughing x93I do this summer Well we were out strolling along about a mile below here on the cross-road; and all of a sudden just as if they sprung right up out of the ground I saw a man with an organ and a monkey and a little girl coming along the road She was crying and as soon as Prince saw that he gave a growl and then the man saw us and he looked so mean and cringing I knew there must be something wrong and I inquired of him what he was doing with that little girl and then she looked up and begged so with her eyes and all of a sudden broke away from him and ran towards me screaming--I want Polly! Well the man sprang after her; then I tell you--x94 here the boy forgot his caution about waking Phronsie--x93we went for him Prince and I! Prince is a noble fellowx94 (here the dogs ears twitched very perceptibly) x93and he kept at that man; oh! how he bit him! till he had to run for fear the monkey would get killedx94 x93Was Phronsie frightened?x94 asked Ben; x93shes never seen strangersx94 x93Not a bitx94 said the boy cheerily; x93she just clung to me like everything--I only wish she was my sisterx94 he added impulsively x93What were you going to do with her if I hadnt come along?x94 asked Ben x93Well I got out on the main roadx94 said the boy x93because I thought anybody who had lost her would probably come through this way; but if somebody hadnt come I was going to carry her in to Hingham; and the father and Id had to contrive some way to dox94 x93Wellx94 said Ben as the boy finished and fastened his bright eyes on him x93somebody did come along; and now I must get her home about as fast as I can for poor mammy--and Polly!x94 x93Yesx94 said the boy x93Ill help you lift her; perhaps she wont wake upx94 The big dog moved away a step or two but still kept his eye on Phronsie x93Therex94 said the boy brightly as they laid the child on the wagon seat; x93now when you get in you can hold her head; thats itx94 he added seeing them both fixed to his satisfaction But still Ben lingered x93Thank youx94 he tried to say x93I knowx94 laughed the boy; x93only its Prince instead of mex94 and he pulled forward the big black creature who had followed faithfully down the hill to see the last of it x93To the front sir there! Were coming to see youx94 he continued x93if you will let us--where do you live?x94 x93Do comex94 said Ben lighting up for he was just feeling he couldnt bear to look his last on the merry honest face; x93anybodyll tell you where Mrs Pepper livesx94 x93Is she a Pepper?x94 asked the boy laughing and pointing to the unconscious little heap in the wagon; x93and are you a Pepper?x94 x93Yesx94 said Ben laughing too x93There are five of us besides mother x93Jolly! thats something like! Good-bye! Come on Prince!x94 Then away home to mother! Phronsie never woke up or turned over once till she was put a little pink sleepy heap into her mothers arms Joel was there crying bitterly at his forlorn search The testy old gentleman in the seat opposite had relented and ordered the coach about and brought him home in an outburst of grief when all hope was gone And one after another they all had come back disheartened to the distracted mother Polly alone clung to hope! x93Ben will bring her mammy; I know God will let himx94 she whispered But when Ben did bring her Polly for the second time in her life tumbled over with a gasp into old Mrs Bascoms lap Home and mother! Little Phronsie slept all that night straight through The neighbors came in softly and with awestruck visages stole into the bedroom to look at the child; and as they crept out again thoughts of their own little ones tugging at their hearts the tears would drop unheeded NEW FRIENDS Up the stairs of the hotel two steps at a time ran a boy with a big black dog at his heels x93Come on Prince; soft nowx94 as they neared a door at the end of the corridors It opened into a corner room overlooking x93the Parkx94 as the small open space in front of the hotel was called Within the room there was sunshine and comfort it being the most luxurious one in the house which the proprietor had placed at the disposal of this most exacting guest He didnt look very happy however--the gentleman who sat in an easy chair by the window; a large handsome old gentleman whose whole bearing showed plainly that personal comfort had always been his and was therefore neither a matter of surprise nor thankfulness x93Where have you been?x94 he asked turning around to greet the boy who came in followed by Prince x93Oh such a long story father!x94 he cried flushed; his eyes sparkling as he flung back the dark hair from his forehead x93You cant even guess!x94 x93Never mind nowx94 said the old gentleman testily; x93your stories are always long; the paper hasnt come--strange indeed that one must needs be so annoyed! do ring that bell againx94 So the bell was pulled; and a porter popped in his head x93What is it sir?x94 x93The paperx94 said the old gentleman irritably; x93hasnt it come yet?x94 x93No sirx94 said the man; and then he repeated x93taint in yet please sirx94 x93Very well--you said so once; thats allx94 waving his hand; then as the door closed he said to his son x93That pays one for coming to such an out-of-the-way country place as this away from papers--I never will do it againx94 As the old gentleman against the advice of many friends who knew his dependence on externals had determined to come to this very place the boy was not much startled at the decisive words He stood very quietly however until his father finished Then he said x93Its too bad father! supposing I tell you my story? Perhaps youll enjoy hearing it while you wait--its really quite newspaperishx94 x93Well you might as well tell it now I supposex94 said the old gentleman; x93but it is a great shame about that paper! to advertise that morning papers are to be obtained--its a swindle Jasper! a complete swindle!x94 and the old gentleman looked so very irate that the boy exerted himself to soothe him x93I knowx94 he said; x93but they cant help the trains being latex94 x93They shouldnt have the trains latex94 said his father unreasonably x93Theres no necessity for all this prating about trains late Im convinced its because they forgot to send down for the papers till they were all soldx94 x93I dont believe thats it fatherx94 said the boy trying to change the subject; x93but you dont know how splendid Prince has been nor--x94 x93And then such a breakfast!x94 continued the old gentleman x93My liver certainly will be in a dreadful state if these things continue!x94 And he got up and going to the corner of the room opened his medicine chest and taking a box of pills therefrom he swallowed two which done he came back with a somewhat easier expression to his favorite chair x93He was just splendid fatherx94 began the boy; x93he went for him I tell you!x94 x93I hope Jasper your dog has not been doing anything violentx94 said the old gentleman x93I must caution you; hell get you into trouble some day; and then therell be a heavy bill to pay; he grows more irritable every dayx94 x93Irritable!x94 cried the boy flinging his arms around the dogs neck who was looking up at the old gentleman in high disdain x93Hes done the most splendid thing you ever saw! Why he saved a little girl father from a cross old organ-man and he drove that man--oh! you ought to have seen him run!x94 And now that it was over Jasper put back his head and laughed long and loud as he remembered the rapid transit of the musical pair x93Well how do you know she wasnt the mans daughter?x94 asked his father determined to find fault someway x93You havent any business to go around the country setting your dog on people I shall have an awful bill to pay some day Jasper--an awful bill!x94 he continued getting up and commencing to pace up and down the floor in extreme irritation x93Fatherx94 cried the boy half laughing half vexed springing to his side and keeping step with him x93we found her brother; he came along when we were by the side of the road We couldnt go any further for the poor little thing was all tired out And dont you think they live over in Badgertown and--x94 x93Wellx94 said the old gentleman pausing in his walk and taking out his watch to wonder if that paper would ever come x93she had probably followed the organ-man; so it served her right after allx94 x93Well but fatherx94 and the boys dark eyes glowed x93she was such a cunning little thing! she wasnt more than four years old; and she had such a pretty little yellow head; and she said so funny--I want Pollyx94 x93Did she?x94 said the old gentleman getting interested in spite of himself; x93what then?x94 x93Why then sirx94 said Jasper delighted at his success in diverting his thoughts x93Prince and I waited--and waited; and I was just going to bring her here to ask you what we should do when--x94 x93Dear me!x94 said the old gentleman instinctively starting back as if he actually saw the forlorn little damsel x93you neednt ever bring such people here Jasper! I dont know what to do with them Im sure!x94 x93Wellx94 said the boy laughing x93we didnt have to did we Prince?x94 stroking the big head of the dog who was slowly following the two as they paced up and down but keeping carefully on the side of his master; x93for just as we really didnt know what to do dont you think there was a big wagon came along drawn by the ricketiest old horse and a boy in the wagon looking both sides of the road and into every bush just as wild as he could be and before I could think hardly he spied us and if he didnt jump! I thought hed broken his leg--x94 x93And I suppose he just abused you for what you had donex94 observed the old gentleman petulantly; x93thats about all the gratitude there is in this worldx94 x93He didnt seem to see me at allx94 said the boy x93I thought hed eat the little girl upx94 x93Ought to have looked out for her better thenx94 grumbled the old gentleman determined to find fault with somebody x93And hes a splendid fellow I just knowx94 cried Jasper waxing enthusiastic; x93and his name is Pepperx94 x93Pepper!x94 repeated his father; x93no nice family ever had the name of Pepper!x94 x93Well I dont carex94 and Jaspers laugh was loud and merry; x93hes nice anyway--I know; and the little things nice; and Im going to see them--cant I father?x94 x93Dear me!x94 said his father; x93how can you Jasper? You do have the strangest tastes I ever saw!x94 x93Its dreadful dull herex94 pleaded the boy touching the right string; x93you know that yourself father and I dont know any boys around here; and Prince and I are so lonely on our walks--do permit me father!x94 The old gentleman who really cared very little about it turned away muttering x93Well Im sure I dont care; go where you likex94 when a knock was heard at the door and the paper was handed in which broke up the conversation and restored good humor The next day but one Ben was out by the wood-pile trying to break up some kindlings for Polly who was washing up the dishes and otherwise preparing for the delights of baking day x93Hulloa!x94 said a voice bethought he knew He turned around to see the merry-faced boy and the big black dog who immediately began to wag his tail as if willing to recognize him x93You see I thought youd never look roundx94 said the boy with a laugh x93Hows the little girl?x94 x93Oh! you have come reallyx94 cried Ben springing over the wood-pile with a beaming face x93Polly!x94 But Polly was already by the door with dish-cloth in hand x93This is my sister Pollyx94 began Ben--and then stopped not knowing the boys name x93Im Jasper Kingx94 said the boy stepping upon the flat stone by Pollys side; and taking off his cap he put out his hand x93And this is Princex94 he added Polly put her hand in his and received a hearty shake; and then she sprang over the big stove dish-cloth and all and just flung her arms around the dogs neck x93Oh you splendid fellow you!x94 said she x93Dont you know we all think youre as good as gold?x94 The dog submitted to the astonishing proceeding as if he liked it while Jasper delighted with Pollys appreciation beamed down on them and struck up friendship with her on the instant x93Now I must call Phronsiex94 said Polly getting up her face as red as a rose x93Is her name Phronsie?x94 asked the boy with interest x93No its Sophroniax94 said Polly x93but we call her Phronsiex94 x93What a very funny namex94 said Jasper x93Sophronia is for such a little thing--and yours is Polly is it not?x94 he asked turning around suddenly on her x93Yesx94 said Polly; x93no not truly Polly; its Mary my real name is--but Ive always been Pollyx94 x93I like Polly best toox94 declared Jasper x93it sounds so nicex94 x93And his name is Benx94 said Polly x93Ebenezer you meanx94 said Ben correcting her x93Well we call him Benx94 said Polly; x93it dont ever seem as if there was any Ebenezer about itx94 x93I should think notx94 laughed Jasper x93Well I must get Phronsiex94 again said Polly running back into the bedroom where that small damsel was busily engaged in washing x93Babyx94 in the basin of water that she had with extreme difficulty succeeded in getting down on the floor She had then by means of a handful of soft soap taken from Pollys soap-bowl during the dish-washing and a bit of old cotton plastered both herself and x93Babyx94 to a comfortable degree of stickiness x93Phronsiex94 said Polly--x93dear me! what you doing? the big dogs out there you know that scared the naughty organ-man; and the boy--x94 but before the words were half out Phronsie had slipped from under her hands and to Pollys extreme dismay clattered out into the kitchen x93Here she is!x94 cried Jasper meeting her at the door The little soapy hands were grasped and kissing her--x93Ugh!x94 he said as the soft soap plentifully spread on her face met his mouth x93Oh Phronsie! you shouldntx94 cried Polly and then they all burst out into a peal of laughter at Jaspers funny grimaces x93Shes been washing Babyx94 explained Polly wiping her eyes and looking at Phronsie who was hanging over Prince in extreme affection Evidently Prince still regarded her as his especial property x93Have you got a baby?x94 asked Jasper x93I thought she was the babyx94 pointing to Phronsie x93Oh I mean her littlest dolly; she always calls her Babyx94 said Polly x93Come Phronsie and have your face washed and a clean apron onx94 When Phronsie could be fairly persuaded that Prince would not run away during her absence she allowed herself to be taken off; and soon re-appeared her own dainty little self Ben in the meantime had been initiating Jasper into the mysteries of cutting the wood the tool-house and all the surroundings of the x93little brown housex94 They had received a re-inforcement in the advent of Joel and David who stared delightedly at Phronsies protector made friends with the dog and altogether had had such a thoroughly good time that Phronsie coming back clapped her hands in glee to hear them x93I wish mammy was homex94 said Polly polishing up the last cup carefully x93Let me put it upx94 said Jasper taking it from her x93it goes up here dont it with the rest?x94 reaching up to the upper-shelf of the old cupboard x93Yesx94 said Polly x93Oh I should think youd have real good times!x94 said the boy enviously x93I havent a single sister or brotherx94 x93Havent you?x94 said Polly looking at him in extreme pity x93Yes we do have real funx94 she added answering his questioning look; x93the house is just brimful sometimes even if we are poorx94 x93We arent poorx94 said Joel who never could bear to be pitied Then with a very proud air he said in a grand way x93At any rate we arent going to be long for somethings coming!x94 x93What do you mean Joey?x94 asked Ben while the rest looked equally amazed x93Our shipsx94 said Joel confidently as if they were right before their eyes; at which they all screamed! x93See Pollys stove!x94 cried Phronsie wishing to entertain in her turn x93Here tisx94 running up to it and pointing with her fat little finger x93Yes I seex94 cried Jasper pretending to be greatly surprised; x93its new isnt it?x94 x93Yesx94 said the child; x93its very all new; four yesterdays ago!x94 And then Polly stopped in sweeping up and related with many additions and explanations from the others the history of the stove and good Dr Fisher (upon whom they all dilated at great length) and the dreadful measles and everything And Jasper sympathized and rejoiced with them to their hearts content and altogether got so very home-like that they all felt as if they had known him for a year Ben neglected his work a little but then visitors didnt come every day to the Peppers; so while Polly worked away at her bread which she was x93going to make like biscuitsx94 she said the audience gathered in the little old kitchen was in the merriest mood and enjoyed everything to the fullest extent x93Do put in another stick Bensie dearx94 said Polly; x93this bread wont be fit for anything!x94 x93Isnt this fun though!x94 cried Jasper running up to try the oven; x93I wish I could ever bakex94 and he looked longingly at the little brown biscuits waiting their turn out on the table x93You come out some dayx94 said Polly sociably x93and well all try baking--mammyd like to have you I knowx94 feeling sure that nothing would be too much for Mrs Pepper to do for the protector of little Phronsie x93I will!x94 cried Jasper perfectly delighted x93You cant think how awfully dull it is out in Hingham!x94 x93Dont you live there?x94 asked Polly with a gasp almost dropping a tin full of little brown lumps of dough she was carrying to the oven x93Live there!x94 cried Jasper; and then he burst out into a merry laugh x93No indeed! I hope not! Why were only spending the summer there father and I in the hotelx94 x93Wheres your mother?x94 asked Joel squeezing in between Jasper and his audience And then they all felt instinctively that a very wrong question had been asked x93I havent any motherx94 said the boy in a low voice They all stood quite still for a moment; then Polly said x93I wish youd come out sometime; and you may bake--or anything elsex94 she added; and there was a kinder ring to her voice than ever No mother! Polly for her life couldnt imagine how anybody could feel without a mother but the very words alone smote her heart; and there was nothing she wouldnt have done to give pleasure to one who had done so much for them x93I wish you could see our motherx94 she said gently x93Why here she comes now! oh mamsie dearx94 she cried x93Do Joe run and take her bundlex94 Mrs Pepper stopped a minute to kiss Phronsie--her baby was dearer than ever to her now Then her eye fell on Jasper who stood respectfully waiting and watching her with great interest x93Is thisx94 she asked taking it all in at the first glance--the boy with the honest eyes as Ben had described him--and the big black dog--x93is this the boy who saved my little girl?x94 x93Oh maamx94 cried Jasper x93I didnt do much; twas Princex94 x93I guess you neverll know how much you did dox94 said Mrs Pepper Then looking with a long keen gaze into the boys eyes that met her own so frankly and kindly x93Ill trust himx94 she said to herself; x93a boy with those eyes cant help but be goodx94 x93Her eyes are just the same as Pollysx94 thought Jasper x93just such laughing ones only Pollys are brownx94 and he liked her on the spot And then somehow the hubbub ceased Polly went on with her work and the others separated and Mrs Pepper and Jasper had a long talk When the mothers eyes fell on Phronsie playing around on the floor she gave the boy a grateful smile that he thought was beautiful x93Well I declarex94 said Jasper at last looking up at the old clock in the corner by the side of the cupboard x93Im afraid Ill miss the stage and then father neverll let me come again Come Princex94 x93Oh dont gox94 cried Phronsie wailing x93Let doggie stay! Oh make him stay mammy!x94 x93I cant Phronsiex94 said Mrs Pepper smiling x93if he thinks he ought to gox94 x93Ill come againx94 said Jasper eagerly x93if I may maamx94 He looked up at Mrs Pepper as he stood cap in hand waiting for the answer x93Im sure we should be glad if your fatherll be willingx94 she added; thinking proudly x93My children are an honor to anybody Im surex94 as she glanced around on the bright little group she could call her own x93But be sure Jasperx94 and she laid her hand on his arm as she looked down into his eyes x93that you father is willing thats allx94 x93Oh yes maamx94 said the boy; x93but he will be I guess if he feels wellx94 x93Then come on Thursdayx94 said Polly; x93and cant we bake something then mammy?x94 x93Im sure I dont carex94 laughed Mrs Pepper; x93but you wont find much but brown flour and meal to bake withx94 x93Well we can pretendx94 said Polly; x93and we can cut the cakes with the heart-shape and theyll do for anything x93Oh Ill comex94 laughed Jasper ready for such lovely fun in the old kitchen; x93look out for me on Thursday Ben!x94 So Jasper and Prince took their leave all the children accompanying them to the gate; and then after seeing him fairly started on a smart run to catch the stage Prince scampering at his heels they all began to sing his praises and to wish for Thursday to come But Jasper didnt come! Thursday came and went; a beautiful bright sunny day but with no signs of the merry boy whom all had begun to love nor of the big black dog The children had made all the needful preparations with much ostentation and bustle and were in a state of excited happiness ready for any gale But the last hope had to be given up as the old clock ticked away hour after hour And at last Polly had to put Phronsie to bed who wouldnt stop crying enough to eat her supper at the dreadful disappointment x93He couldnt come I knowx94 said both Ben and Polly standing staunchly up for their new friend; but Joel and David felt that he had broken his word x93He promisedx94 said Joel vindictively x93I dont believe his fatherd let himx94 said Polly wiping away a sly tear; x93I know Jasperd come if he couldx94 Mrs Pepper wisely kept her own counsel simply giving them a kindly caution x93Dont you go to judging him children till you knowx94 x93Well he promisedx94 said Joel as a settler x93Arent you ashamed Joelx94 said his mother x93to talk about any one whose back is turned? Wait till he tells you the reason himselfx94 Joel hung his head and then began to tease David in the corner to make up for his disappointment The next morning Ben had to go to the store after some more meal As he was going out rather dismally the storekeeper who was also postmaster called out x93Oh halloa there!x94 x93What is it?x94 asked Ben turning back thinking perhaps Mr Atkins hadnt given him the right change x93Herex94 said Mr Atkins stepping up to the Post-office department quite smart with its array of boxes and official notices where Ben had always lingered wishing there might be sometime a letter for him--or some of them x93Youve got a sister Polly havent you?x94 x93Yesx94 said Ben wondering what was coming next x93Well shes got a letterx94 said the postmaster holding up a nice big envelope looking just like those that Ben had so many times wished for That magic piece of white paper danced before the boys eyes for a minute; then he said x93It cant be for her Mr Atkins; why shes never had onex94 x93Well shes got one now sure enoughx94 said Mr Atkins; x93here tis plain enoughx94 and he read what he had no need to study much as it had already passed examination by his own and his wifes faithful eyes x93Miss Polly Pepper near the Turnpike Badgertown--thats her isnt it?x94 he added laying it down before Bens eyes x93Must be a first time for everything you know my boy!x94 and he laughed long over his own joke; x93so take it and run along homex94 For Ben still stood looking at it and not offering to stir x93If you say sox94 said the boy as if Mr Atkins had given him something out of his own pocket; x93but Im afraid tisnt for Pollyx94 Then buttoning up the precious letter in his jacket he spun along home as never before x93Polly! Polly!x94 he screamed x93Where is she mother?x94 x93I dont knowx94 said Mrs Pepper coming out of the bedroom x93Dear me! is anybody hurt Ben?x94 x93I dont knowx94 said Ben in a state to believe anything x93but Pollys got a letterx94 x93Polly got a letter!x94 cried Mrs Pepper; x93what do you mean Ben?x94 x93I dont knowx94 repeated the boy still holding out the precious letter; x93but Mr Atkins gave it to me; where is Polly?x94 x93I know where she isx94 said Joel; x93shes up-stairsx94 And he flew out in a twinkling and just as soon reappeared with Polly scampering after him in the wildest excitement And then the kitchen was in an uproar as the precious missive was put into Pollys hand; and they all gathered around her wondering and examining till Ben thought he would go wild with the delay x93I wonder where it did come fromx94 said Polly in the greatest anxiety examining again the address x93Where does the postmark say?x94 asked Mrs Pepper looking over her shoulder x93Its all rubbed outx94 said Polly peering at it x93you cant see anythingx94 x93Do open itx94 said Ben x93and then youll find outx94 x93But praps tisnt for mex94 said Polly timidly x93Well Mr Atkins says tisx94 said Ben impatiently; x93here Ill open it for you Pollyx94 x93No let her open it for herself Benx94 protested his mother x93But she wontx94 said Ben; x93do tear it open Pollyx94 x93No Im goin to get a knifex94 she said x93Ill get onex94 cried Joel running up to the table drawer; x93heres one Pollyx94 x93Oh dearx94 groaned Ben; x93you neverll get it open at this rate!x94 But at last it was cut; and they all holding their breath gazed awe-struck while Polly drew out the mysterious missive x93What does it say?x94 gasped Mrs Pepper x93Dear Miss Pollyx94 began both Ben and Polly in a breath x93Let Polly readx94 said Joel who couldnt hear in the confusion x93Well go on Pollyx94 said Ben; x93hurry!x94 x93Dear Miss Polly I was so sorry I couldnt come on Thursday--x94 x93Oh its Jasper! its Jasper!x94 cried all the children in a breath x93I told you so!x94 cried Ben and Polly perfectly delighted to find their friend vindicated fully--x93there! Joey Pepper!x94 x93Well I dont carex94 cried Joe nothing daunted x93he didnt come anyway--do go on Pollyx94 x93I was so sorry I couldnt come--x94 began Polly x93You read thatx94 said Joel x93I know itx94 said Polly x93but its just lovely; on Thursday; but my father was sick and I couldnt leave him If you dont mind Ill come again--I mean Ill come some other day if its just as convenient for you for I do so want the baking and the nice time I forgot to say that I had a cold to (here Jasper had evidently had a struggle in his mind whether there should be two os or one and he had at last decided it by crossing out one) but my father is willing I should come when I get well Give my love to all and especially remember me respectfully to your mother Your friend x93JASPER ELYOT KINGx94 x93Oh lovely! lovely!x94 cried Polly flying around with the letter in her hand; x93so he is coming!x94 Ben was just as wild as she was for no one knew but Polly just how the new friend had stepped into his heart Phronsie went to sleep happy hugging x93Babyx94 x93And dont you think Baby dearx94 she whispered sleepily and Polly heard her say as she was tucking her in x93that Jasper is really comin; really--and the big be-you-ti-ful doggie too!x94 PHRONSIE PAYS A DEBT OF GRATITUDE x93And now I tell youx94 said Polly the next day x93lets make Jasper something; cant we ma?x94 x93Oh do! do!x94 cried all the other children x93lets;

x93for Ben knows; and he says we can do itx94 x93Oh well if Ben and you have had your heads together I suppose its all rightx94 laughed Mrs Pepper x93but I dont see how you can do itx94 x93Well we can mother trulyx94 put in Ben x93Ill tell you how and youll say itll be splendid You see Deacon Blodgetts goin over to Hingham to-morrow; I heard him tell Miss Blodgett so; and he goes right past the hotel; and we can do it up real nice--and itll please Jasper so--do mammy!x94 x93And its real dull there Jasper saysx94 put in Polly persuasively; x93and just think mammy no brothers and sisters!x94 And Polly looked around on the others After that there was no need to say anything more; her mother would have consented to almost any plan then x93Well go on childrenx94 she said; x93you may do it; I dont see but what you can get em there well enough; but Im sure I dont know what you can makex94 x93Cant wex94 said Polly--and she knelt down by her mothers side and put her face in between the sewing in Mrs Peppers lap and the eyes bent kindly down on her--x93make some little cakes real cakes I mean? now dont say no mammy!x94 she said alarmed for she saw a x93nox94 slowly coming in the eyes above her as Mrs Pepper began to shake her head x93But we havent any white flour Pollyx94 began her mother x93I knowx94 said Polly; x93but well make em of brown itll do if youll give us some raisins--you know theres some in the bowl mammyx94 x93I was saving them for a nest eggx94 said Mrs Pepper; meaning at some future time to indulge in another plum-pudding that the children so loved x93Well do give em to usx94 cried Polly; x93do ma!x94 x93I want em for a plum-pudding sometimex94 said Mrs Pepper x93Ow!--x94 and Joel with a howl sprung up from the floor where he had been trying to make a cart for x93Babyx94 out of an old box and joined Mrs Pepper and Polly x93No dont give em away ma!x94 he screamed; x93lets have our plum-pudding--now Polly Pepper youre a-goin to bake up all our raisins in nasty little cakes--and--x94 x93Joey!x94 commanded Mrs Pepper x93hush! what word did you say!x94 x93Wellx94 blubbered Joel wiping his tears away with his grimy little hand x93Pollys--a-goin--to give--x94 x93I should rather youd never have a plum-pudding than to say such wordsx94 said Mrs Pepper sternly taking up her work again x93And besides do you think what Jasper has done for you?x94 and her face grew very white around the lips x93Well he can have plum-puddingsx94 said Joel whimpering x93forever an ever if he wants them--and--and--x94 x93Well Joeyx94 said Polly x93there dont feel badx94 and she put her arms around him and tried to wipe away the tears that still rolled down his cheeks x93We wont give em if you dont want us to; but Jaspers sick and there isnt anything for him to do and--x94 here she whispered slyly up into his ear x93dont you remember how you liked folks to send you things when you had the measles?x94 x93Yes I knowx94 said Joel beginning to smile through his tears; x93wasnt it fun Polly?x94 x93I guess twasx94 laughed Polly back again pleased at the return of sunshine x93Well Jasperll be just as pleased as you were cause we love him and want to do somethin for him he was so good to Phronsiex94 x93I will Polly I willx94 cried Joel completely won over; x93do lets make em for him; and put em in thick; oh! thick as you can;x94 and determined to do nothing by halves Joel ran generously for the precious howl of raisins and after setting it on the table began to help Polly in all needful preparations Mrs Pepper smiled away to herself to see happiness restored to the little group And soon a pleasant hum and bustle went on around the baking table the centre of attraction x93Nowx94 said Phronsie coming up to the table and standing on tip-toe to see Polly measure out the flour x93Im a-goin to bake something for my sick man I amx94 x93Oh no Phronsie you cantx94 began Polly x93Hey?x94 asked Joel with a daub of flour on the tip of his chubby nose gained by too much peering into Pollys flour-bag x93What did she say Polly?x94 watching her shake the clouds of flour in the sieve x93She said she was goin to bake something for Jasperx94 said Polly x93Therex94 as she whisked in the flour x93now thats donex94 x93No I didnt say Jasperx94 said Phronsie;

x93poor sick manx94 x93Who does she mean?x94 said Polly in despair stopping a moment her violent stirring that threatened to overturn the whole cake-bowl x93I guess she means Princex94 said Joel x93Cant I stir Polly?x94 x93Oh nox94 said Polly;

x93my sick manx94 x93I shall give up!x94 said Polly tumbling over in a chair with the cake spoon in her hand from which a small sticky lump fell on her apron which Joel immediately pounced upon and devoured x93What do you want to bake Phronsie?x94 she gasped holding the spoon sticking up straight and staring at the child x93A gingerbread boyx94 said the child promptly; x93hed like that best; poor sick man!x94 and she commenced to climb up to active preparations A LETTER TO JASPER x93Mamsie what shall we do?x94 implored Polly of her mother x93I dont knowx94 said her mother; x93however did that get into her head do you suppose?x94 x93I am sure I cant tellx94 said Polly jumping up and beginning to stir briskly to make up for lost time x93Praps she heard us talking about Jaspers having to take care of his sick father and how hard it must be to be sick away from homex94 x93Yesx94 said Phronsie x93but hell be glad to see my gingerbread boy I guess;

x93thats because he baked so funny; it made his feet stick outx94 x93Childrenx94 said Mrs Pepper x93howll Jasper know where the cakes come from?x94 x93Why hell know its usx94 said Polly x93of course;

but being gilt-edged it looked very magnificent to the five pairs of eyes directed to it x93Now Ben you get the ink bottle and the pen and then go to workx94 So Ben reached down from the upper shelf in the cupboard the ink bottle and a pen in a black wooden penholder x93Oh mamsiex94 cried Polly x93thats where Phronsie bit it off when she was a baby isnt it?x94 holding up the stubby end where the little ball had disappeared x93Yesx94 said Mrs Pepper x93and now youre going to write about her gingerbread boy with it--well time goes to be surex94 And she bent over her work again harder than ever Poor woman! if she could only scrape together enough money to get her children into school--that was the earnest wish of her heart She must do it soon for Ben was twelve years old; but with all her strivings and scrimpings she could only manage to put bread into their mouths and live from day to day x93I know I ought to be thankful for thatx94 she said to herself not taking time even to cry over her troubles x93But oh the learning! they must have that!x94 x93Nowx94 said Polly x93howll we do it Ben?x94 as they ranged themselves around the table on which reposed the cakes;

so he went to work laboriously; only his hard breathing showing what a hard task it was as the stiff old pen scratched up and down the paper x93There thats donex94 he cried at length in great satisfaction holding it up for inspection x93Oh I do wishx94 cried Polly in intense admiration x93I could write so nice and so fast as you can Benx94 x93Read it Pollyx94 said Mrs Pepper in pride So Polly began x93Dear Mister Jasper we were all dreadfully sorry that you didnt come and so we baked you some cakes--You didnt say anything about his being sick Benx94 x93I forgot itx94 said Ben x93but I put it in farther down--youll see if you read onx94 x93Baked you some cakes--that is Polly did for this is Ben thats writingx94 x93You neednt said that Benx94 said Polly dissatisfied;

and we liked your letter telling us so Oh Polly! we werent glad to hear he was sick!x94 cried Ben in horror x93I didnt say so!x94 cried Polly starting up x93Why Ben Pepper I never said so!x94 and she looked ready to cry x93It sounds something like it dont it mammy?x94 said Ben unwilling to give her pain but appealing to Mrs Pepper x93Polly didnt mean itx94 said her mother consolingly; x93but if I were you Id say something to explain itx94 x93I cant put anything in nowx94 said poor Polly; x93there isnt any room nor any more paper either--what shall I do! I told you Ben I couldnt writex94 And Polly looked helplessly from one to the other for comfort x93Yes you canx94 said Ben; x93there now Ill show you write it fine Polly--you write so big--little bits of letters like thesex94 So Polly took the pen again with a sigh x93Now he wont think so I guessx94 she said much relieved as Ben began to read again x93Ill begin yours againx94 Ben said x93We most of us knew you were sick because you didnt come and we liked your letter telling us so because wed all felt so badly and Phronsie cried herself to sleep--x94 (thats good Im sure) x93The gingerbread boy is for your father--please excuse it but Phronsie would make it for him because he is sick There isnt any more to write and besides I cant write good and Bens tired From all of usx94 x93Why hows he to know?x94 cried Ben x93That wont do to sign itx94 x93Well lets say from Ben and Polly thenx94 said Polly; x93only all the others want to be in the letterx94 x93Well they cant writex94 said Ben x93We might sign their names for emx94 suggested Polly x93Heres minex94 said Ben putting under the x93From all of usx94 a big bold x93Benx94 x93And heres minex94 echoed Polly setting a slightly crooked x93Pollyx94 by its side x93Now Joe you better let Ben hold your handx94 said Polly warningly But Joel declaring he could write had already begun so there was no hope for it; and a big drop of ink falling from the pen he spattered the x93Jx94 so that no one could tell what it was The children looked at each other in despair x93Can we ever get it out mammy?x94 said Polly running to Mrs Pepper with it x93I dont knowx94 said her mother x93How could you try it Joe?x94 x93I didnt mean tox94 said Joel looking very downcast and ashamed x93The ugly old pen did it!x94 x93Wellx94 said Polly x93its got to go; we cant help itx94 But she looked so sorrowful over it that half the pleasure was gone for Ben; for Polly wanted everything just right and was very particular about things x93Now Davex94 Ben held his hand and x93Davidx94 went down next to Joel But when it was Phronsies turn she protested that Polly and no one else must hold her hand x93Its a dreadful hard name to write--Phronsie isx94 said Polly as she guided Phronsies fat little hand that clung faithfully to the stubby old pen x93There its over nowx94 she cried; x93and Im thankful! I wouldnt write another for anything!x94 x93Read it all over now Benx94 cried Mrs Pepper x93and dont speak children till he gets throughx94 x93Dont it sound elegant!x94 said Polly clasping her hands when he had finished x93I didnt think we ever could do it so nice did you Ben?x94 x93No indeed I didntx94 replied Ben in a highly ecstatic frame of mind x93Now--oh! whatll we do for an envelope?x94 he asked in dismay x93Youll have to do without thatx94 said Mrs Pepper x93for there isnt any in the house--but see here childrenx94 she added as she saw the sorry faces before her--x93you just fold up the letter and put it inside the parcel; thatll be just as goodx94 x93Oh dearx94 said Polly; x93but it would have been splendid the other way mammy--just like other folks!x94 x93You must make believe this is like other folksx94 said Mrs Pepper cheerily x93when you cant do any other wayx94 x93Yesx94 said Ben x93thats so Polly; tie em up quicks you can and Ill take em over to Deacon Blodgetts for hes goin to start early in the morningx94 So after another last look all around Polly put the cakes in the paper and tied it with four or five strong knots to avoid all danger of its undoing x93He neverll untie it Pollyx94 said Ben; x93thats just like a girls knots!x94 x93Why didnt you tie it then?x94 said Polly; x93Im sure its as good as a boys knots and they always muss up a parcel sox94 And she gave a loving approving little pat to the top of the package which despite its multitude of knots was certainly very neat indeed Ben grasping the pen again x93here goes for the direction x93Deary yes!x94 said Polly x93I forgot all about that; I thought twas donex94 x93Howd you spose hed get it?x94 asked Ben coolly beginning the x93Mx94 x93I dont knowx94 replied Polly looking over his shoulder; x93spose anybody else had eaten em up Ben!x94 And she turned pale at the very thought x93Therex94 said Ben at last after a good many flourishes x93now tis done! you cant think of another thing to do to it Polly!x94 x93Mamsie see!x94 cried Polly running with it to Mrs Pepper x93isnt that fine! Mr Jasper E King at the Hotel Hinghamx94 x93Yesx94 said Mrs Pepper admiringly to the content of all the children x93I should think it was!x94 x93Let me take it in my handx94 screamed Joel reaching eagerly up for the tempting brown parcel x93Be careful then Joex94 said Polly with an important air So Joel took a comfortable feel and then Davie must have the same privilege At last it was off and with intense satisfaction the children watched Ben disappear with it down the long hill to Deacon Blodgetts The next day Ben came running in from his work at the deacons x93Oh Polly you had em!x94 he screamed all out of breath x93You had em!x94 x93Had what?x94 asked Polly in astonishment x93Oh Bensie what do you mean?x94 x93Your flowersx94 he panted x93You sent some flowers to Jasperx94 x93Flowers to Jasper!x94 repeated Polly afraid Ben had gone out of his wits x93Yesx94 said Ben; x93Ill begin at the beginning You see Polly when I went down this morning Betsey was to set me to work Deacon Blodgett and Mrs Blodgett had started early you know; and while I was a-cleanin up the woodshed as she told me all of a sudden she said as she stood in the door looking on Oh Ben Mis Blodgett took some posies along with your parcel What? said I; I didnt know as Id heard straight Posies I said says Betsey; beautiful ones they were too the best in the garding I heard her tell Mr Blodgett it would be a pity if that sick boy couldnt have some flowers and she knew the Pepper children were crazy about em so she twisted em in the string around the parcel and there they stood up and looked fine I tell you as they drove away So Polly!x94 x93Bensie Pepper!x94 cried Polly taking hold of his jacket and spinning him round x93I told you so!

Was your father angry about--about--the gingerbread boy?x94 he asked timidly trembling for an answer x93Oh dearx94 cried Jasper tumbling over on the grass x93dont dont! I shant be good for anything if you make me laugh! oh! wasnt it funny;x94 and he rolled over and over shaking with glee x93Yesx94 said Ben immensely relieved to find that no offence had been taken x93But she would send it; Polly tried not to have her and she most cried when Phronsie was so determined cause she said your father neverd let you come again--x94 x93Twas just lovely in Phronsiex94 said the boy sitting up and wiping his eyes x93but oh it was so funny! you ought to have seen my father Ben Pepperx94 x93Oh then he was angryx94 cried Ben x93No indeed he wasnt!x94 said Jasper; x93dont you think it! do you know it did him lots of good for hed been feeling real badly that morning he hadnt eaten any breakfast and when he saw that gingerbread boy--x94 here Jasper rolled over again with a peal of laughter--x93and heard the message he just put back his head and he laughed--why I never heard him laugh as he did then! the room shook all over; and he ate a big dinner and all that afternoon he felt as good as could be But he says hes coming to see the little girl that baked it for him before we go homex94 Ben nearly tumbled over by the side of Jasper at these words--x93Coming to see us!x94 he gasped x93Yesx94 said Jasper who had scarcely got over his own astonishment about it for if the roof had suddenly whisked off on to the church steeple he couldnt have been more amazed than when he heard his father say cheerily x93Well Jasper my boy I guess I shall have to drive over and see your little girl since shes been polite enough to bake me thisx94 pointing to the wild-looking x93gingerbread boyx94 x93Come in and tell em about itx94 cried Ben radiantly picking up his potatoes and salt x93Its all right Polly!x94 he said in a jubilant voice x93for heres Jasper and hell tell you so himselfx94 x93Hush!x94 said Jasper warningly x93dont let Phronsie hear; well heres my pet nowx94 and after bobbing lovingly to the others with eyes beaming over with fun he caught up the little girl who was screaming--x93Oh heres Jasper! and my beyew-ti-ful doggie!x94 x93Now Phronsiex94 he cried x93give me a kiss; you havent any soft soap to-day have you? no; thats a good nice one now; your gingerbread boy was just splendid!x94 x93Did he eat it?x94 asked the child in grave delight x93Well--no--he hasnt eaten it yetx94 said Jasper smiling on the others; x93hes keeping it to look at Phronsiex94 x93I should think so!x94 groaned Polly x93Never mind Pollyx94 Ben whispered; x93Jaspers been a-tellin me about it; his father liked it--he did trulyx94 x93Oh!x94 said Polly x93Im so glad!x94 x93He had eyesx94 said Phronsie going back to the charms of the x93gingerbread boyx94 x93I know itx94 said Jasper admiringly; x93so he didx94 x93Rather deep sunk one of em wasx94 muttered Ben x93And Ill bake you one Jasperx94 said the child as he put her down; x93I will very truly--some dayx94 x93Will youx94 smiled Jasper; x93well thenx94 and there was a whispered conference with Phronsie that somehow sent that damsel into a blissful state of delight And then while Phronsie monopolized Prince Jasper told them all about the reception of the parcel--how very dull and forlorn he was feeling that morning Prince and he shut up in-doors--and how his father had had a miserable night and had eaten scarcely no breakfast and just at this juncture there came a knock at the door x93andx94 said Jasper x93your parcel walked in all dressed up in flowers!x94 x93They werent our flowersx94 said Polly honestly x93Mrs Blodgett put em onx94 x93Well she couldnt have if you hadnt sent the parcelx94 said Jasper in a tone of conviction Then he launched out into a description of how they opened the package--Prince looking on and begging for one of the cakes x93Oh didnt you give him one?x94 cried Polly at this x93Good old Prince!x94 x93Yes I didx94 said Jasper x93the biggest one of allx94 x93The one I guessx94 interrupted Joel x93with the big raisin on topx94 Polly spoke up quickly to save any more remarks on Joels part x93Now tell us about your father--and the gingerbread boyx94 So Jasper broke out with a merry laugh into this part of the story and soon had them all in such a gale of merriment that Phronsie stopped playing out on the door-step with Prince and came in to see what the matter was x93Never mindx94 said Polly trying to get her breath just as Jasper was relating how Mr King set up the x93gingerbread boyx94 on his writing table before him while he leaned back in his chair for a hearty laugh x93And to make it funnier stillx94 said Jasper x93dont you think a little pen-wiper he has made like a cap hanging on the pen-rack above him tumbled off just at this very identical minute right on the head of the gingerbread boy and there it stuck!x94 x93Oh!x94 they all screamed x93if we could only have seen itx94 x93What was it?x94 asked Phronsie pulling Pollys sleeve to make her hear So Jasper took her in his lap and told how funny the x93gingerbread boyx94 looked with a cap on and Phronsie clapped her hands and laughed with the rest till the little old kitchen rang and rang again And then they had the baking! and Polly tied one of her mothers ample aprons on Jasper as Mrs Pepper had left directions if he should come while she was away; and he developed such a taste for cookery and had so many splendid improvements on the Peppers simple ideas that the children thought it the most fortunate thing in the world that he came; and one and all voted him a most charming companion x93You could cook a Thanksgiving dinner in this stove just as easy as notx94 said Jasper putting into the oven something on a little cracked plate that would have been a pie if there were any centre; but lacking that necessary accompaniment probably was a short-cake x93Just as easy as notx94 he repeated with emphasis slamming the door to give point to his remarks x93No you couldnt eitherx94 said Ben at the table with equal decision; x93not a bit of it Jasper King!x94 x93Why Ben Pepper?x94 asked Jasper x93that ovens big enough! I should like to know why not?x94 x93Cause there isnt anything to cookx94 said Ben coolly cutting out a piece of dough for a jumble; x93we dont keep Thanksgivingx94 x93Not keep Thanksgiving!x94 said Jasper standing quite still; x93never had a Thanksgiving! well I declarex94 and then he stopped again x93Yesx94 answered Ben; x93we had one once; twas last year--but that wasnt muchx94 x93Well thenx94 said Jasper leaning over the table x93Ill tell you what I should think youd do--try Christmasx94 x93Oh thats always worsex94 said Polly setting down her rolling-pin to think--which immediately rolled away by itself off from the table x93We never had a Christmasx94 said little Davie reflectively; x93what are they like Jasper?x94 Jasper sat quite still and didnt reply to this question for a moment or two To be among children who didnt like Thanksgiving and who x93never had seen a Christmasx94 and x93didnt know what it was likex94 was a new revelation to him x93They hang up stockingsx94 said Polly softly How many many times she had begged her mother to try it for the younger ones; but there was never anything to put in them and the winters were cold and hard and the strictest economy only carried them through x93Oh!x94 said little Phronsie in horror x93are their feet in em Polly?x94 x93No dearx94 said Polly; while Jasper instead of laughing only stared Something requiring a deal of thought was passing through the boys mind just then x93They shall have a Christmas!x94 he muttered x93I know fatherll let mex94 But he kept his thoughts to himself; and becoming his own gay kindly self he explained and told to Phronsie and the others so many stories of past Christmases he had enjoyed that the interest over the baking soon dwindled away until a horrible smell of something burning brought them all to their senses x93Oh! the house is burning!x94 cried Polly x93Oh get a pail of water!x94 x93Tisnt eitherx94 said Jasper snuffing wisely; x93oh! I know--I forgot all about it--I do beg your pardonx94 And running to the stove he knelt down and drew out of the oven a black odorous mass which with a crest-fallen air he brought to Polly x93Im no end sorry I made such a mess of itx94 he said x93I meant it for youx94 x93Tisnt any matterx94 said Polly kindly x93And now do you go onx94 cried Joel and David both in the same breath x93all about the Tree you knowx94 x93Yes yesx94 said the others; x93if youre not tired Jasperx94 x93Oh nox94 cried their accommodating friend x93I love to tell about it; only wait--lets help Polly clear up firstx94 So after all traces of the frolic had been tidied up and made nice for the mothers return they took seats in a circle and Jasper regaled them with story and reminiscence till they felt as if fairy land were nothing to it! x93How did you ever live through it Jasper Kingx94 said Polly drawing the first long breath she had dared to indulge in x93Such an elegant time!x94 Jasper laughed x93I hope Ill live through plenty more of themx94 he said merrily x93Were going to sister Marians again father and I; we always spend our Christmas there you know and shes to have all the cousins and I dont know how many more; and a tree--but the best of all theres going to be a German carol sung by choir boys--I shall like that best of allx94 x93What are choir boys?x94 asked Polly who was intensely fond of music x93In some of the churchesx94 explained Jasper x93the choir is all boys; and they do chant and sing anthems perfectly beautifully Polly!x94 x93Do you play on the piano and sing?x94 asked Polly looking at him in awe x93Yesx94 said the boy simply; x93Ive played ever since I was a little fellow no biggern Phronsiex94 x93Oh Jasper!x94 cried Polly clasping her hands her cheeks all aflame--x93do you mean to say you do really and truly play on the piano?x94 x93Why yesx94 said the boy looking into her flashing eyes x93Pollys always crazy about musicx94 explained Ben; x93shell drum on the table and anywhere to make believe its a pianox94 x93Theres Dr Fisher going byx94 said Joel who now that they had gotten on the subject of music began to find prickles running up and down his legs from sitting so still x93I wish hed stopx94 x93Is he the one that cured your measles--and Pollys eyes?x94 asked Jasper running to the window x93I want to see himx94 x93Well there he isx94 cried Ben as the doctor put his head out of the gig and bowed and smiled to the little group in the window x93Hes just lovelyx94 cried Polly x93oh! I wish you knew himx94 x93If fathers sick againx94 said Jasper x93well have him--he looks nice anyway--for father dont like the doctor over in Hingham--do you know perhaps well come again next summer; wouldnt that be nice!x94 x93Oh!x94 cried the children rapturously; x93do come Jasper do!x94 x93Well maybex94 said Jasper x93if father likes it and sister Marian and her family will come with us; they do some summers Youd like little Dick I knowx94 turning to Phronsie x93And I guess all of youd like all of themx94 he added looking at the group of interested listeners x93They wanted to come this year awfully; they said--Oh grandpapa do let us go with you and Jappy and--x94 x93What!x94 said the children x93Ohx94 said Jasper with a laugh x93they call me Jappy--its easier to say than Jasper; ever so many people do for short You may if you want tox94 he said looking around on them all x93How funny!x94 laughed Polly x93But I dont know as it is any worse than Polly or Benx94 x93Or Phronsiex94 said Jappy x93Dont you like Jappy?x94 he said bringing his head down to her level as she sat on the little stool at his feet content in listening to the merry chat x93Is that the same as Jasper?x94 she asked gravely x93Yes the very samex94 he said When they parted--Jappy and the little Peppers were sworn friends; and the boy happy in his good times in the cheery little home felt the hours long between the visits that his father when he saw the change that they wrought in his son willingly allowed him to make x93Oh dear!x94 said Mrs Pepper one day in the last of September--as a carriage drawn by a pair of very handsome horses stopped at their door x93here comes Mr King I do believe; we never looked worsen we do to-day!x94 x93I dont carex94 said Polly flying out of the bedroom x93Jappys with him mamma and itll be nice I guess At any rate Phronsies clean as a pinkx94 she thought to herself looking at the little maiden busy with x93babyx94 to whom she was teaching deportment in the corner But there was no time to x93fix up;x94 for a tall portly gentleman leaning on his heavy gold cane was walking up from the little brown gate to the big flat-stone that served as a step Jasper and Prince followed decorously x93Is this little Miss Pepper?x94 he asked pompously of Polly who answered his rap on the door Now whether she was little x93Miss Pepperx94 she never had stopped to consider x93I dont know sir; Im Pollyx94 And then she blushed bright as a rose and the laughing brown eyes looked beyond to Jasper who stood on the walk and smiled encouragingly x93Is your mother in?x94 asked the old gentleman who was so tall he could scarcely enter the low door And then Mrs Pepper came forward and Jasper introduced her and the old gentleman bowed and sat down in the seat Polly placed for him And Mrs Pepper thanked him with a heart overflowing with gratitude through lips that would tremble even then for all that Jasper had done for them And the old gentleman said--x93Humph!x94 but he looked at his son and something shone in his eye just for a moment Phronsie had retreated with x93babyx94 in her arms behind the door on the new arrival But seeing everything progressing finely and overcome by her extreme desire to see Jappy and Prince she began by peeping out with big eyes to observe how things were going on Just then the old gentleman happened to say x93Well where is my little girl that baked me a cake so kindly?x94 Then Phronsie forgetting all else but her x93poor sick manx94 who also was x93Jaspers fatherx94 rushed out from behind the door and coming up to the stately old gentleman in the chair she looked up pityingly and said shaking her yellow head x93Poor sick man was my boy good?x94 After that there was no more gravity and ceremony In a moment Phronsie was perched upon old Mr Kings knee and playing with his watch; while the others freed from all restraint were chatting and laughing happily till some of the cheeriness overflowed and warmed the heart of the old gentleman x93We go to-morrowx94 he said rising and looking at his watch x93Why is it possible that we have been here an hour! there my little girl will you give me a kiss?x94 and he bent his handsome old head down to the childish face upturned to his confidingly x93Dont gox94 said the child as she put up her little lips in grave confidence x93I do like you--I do!x94 x93Oh Phronsiex94 began Mrs Pepper x93Dont reprove her madamx94 said the old gentleman who liked it immensely x93Yes we go to-morrowx94 he said looking around on the group to whom this was a blow they little expected They had surely thought Jasper was to stay a week longer x93I received a telegram this morning that I must be in the city on Thursday And besides madamx94 he said addressing Mrs Pepper x93I think the climate is bad for me now as it induces rheumatism The hotel is also getting unpleasant; there are many annoyances that I cannot put up with; so that altogether I do not regret itx94 Mrs Pepper not knowing exactly what to say to this wisely said nothing Meantime Jappy and the little Peppers were having a sorry time over in the corner by themselves x93Well Ill writex94 cried Jasper not liking to look at Polly just then as he was sure he shouldnt want anyone to look at him if he felt like crying x93And you must answer em allx94 x93Oh we will! we will!x94 they cried x93And Jappy do come next summerx94 said Joel x93If fatherll only say yes we will I tell you!x94 he responded eagerly x93Come my boyx94 said his father the third time; and Jasper knew by the tone that there must be no delay Mr King had been nervously putting his hand in his pocket during the last few moments that the children were together; but when he glanced at Mrs Peppers eyes something made him draw it out again hastily as empty as he put it in x93No twouldnt dox94 he said to himself; x93she isnt the kind of woman to whom one could offer moneyx94 The children crowded back their tears and hastily said their last good-bye some of them hanging on to Prince till the last moment And then the carriage door shut with a bang Jasper giving them a bright parting smile and they were gone And the Peppers went into their little brown house and shut the door GETTING A CHRISTMAS FOR THE LITTLE ONES And so October came and went The little Peppers were very lonely after Jasper had gone; even Mrs Pepper caught herself looking up one day when the wind blew the door open suddenly half expecting to see the merry whole-souled boy and the faithful dog come scampering in But the letters came--and that was a comfort; and it was fun to answer them The first one spoke of Jaspers being under a private tutor with his cousins; then they were less frequent and they knew he was studying hard Full of anticipations of Christmas himself he urged the little Peppers to try for one And the life and spirit of the letter was so catching that Polly and Ben found their souls fired within them to try at least to get for the little ones a taste of Christmastide x93Now mammyx94 they said at last one day in the latter part of October when the crisp fresh air filled their little healthy bodies with springing vitality that must bubble over and rush into something x93we dont want a Thanksgiving--truly we dont But may we try for a Christmas--just a little onex94 they added timidly x93for the children?x94 Ben and Polly always called the three younger ones of the flock x93the childrenx94 To their utter surprise Mrs Pepper looked mildly assenting and presently she said x93Well I dont see why you cant try; twont do any harm Im surex94 You see Mrs Pepper had received a letter from Jasper which at present she didnt feel called upon to say anything about x93Nowx94 said Polly drawing a long breath as she and Ben stole away into a corner to x93talk overx94 and lay plans x93what does it mean?x94 x93Never mindx94 said Ben; x93as long as shes given us leave I dont care what it isx94 x93I neitherx94 said Polly with the delicious feeling as if the whole world were before them where to choose; x93itll be just gorgeous Ben!x94 x93Whats that?x94 asked Ben who was not as much given to long words as Polly who dearly loved to be fine in language as well as other things x93Oh its something Jappy said one day; and I asked him and he says its fine and lovely and all thatx94 answered Polly delighted that she knew something she could really tell Ben x93Then why not say fine?x94 commented Ben practically with a little upward lift of his nose x93Oh Id know Im surex94 laughed Polly x93Lets think whatll we do for Christmas--how many weeks are there anyway Ben?x94 And she began to count on her fingers x93Thats no wayx94 said Ben x93Im going to get the Almanacx94 So he went to the old clock where hanging up by its side was a x93Farmers Almanacx94 x93Now well knowx94 he said coming back to their corner So with heads together they consulted and counted up till they found that eight weeks and three days remained in which to get ready x93Dear me!x94 said Polly x93Its most a year isnt it Ben?x94 x93Twont be much time for usx94 said Ben who thought of the many hours to be devoted to hard work that would run away with the time x93Wed better begin right away Pollyx94 x93Well all rightx94 said Polly who could scarcely keep her fingers still as she thought of the many things she should so love to do if she could x93But first Ben what lets do?x94 x93Would you rather hang up their stockings?x94 asked Ben as if he had unlimited means at his disposal; x93or have a tree?x94 x93Whyx94 said Polly with wide open eyes at the two magnificent ideas x93we havent got anything to put in the stockings when we hang em Benx94 x93Thats just itx94 said Ben x93Now wouldnt it be better to have a tree Polly? I can get that easy in the woods you knowx94 x93Wellx94 interrupted Polly eagerly x93we havent got anything to hang on that either Ben You know Jappy said folks hang all sorts of presents on the branches So I dont seex94 she continued impatiently x93as thats any good We cant do anything Ben Pepper so there! there isnt anything to do anything withx94 and with a flounce Polly sat down on the old wooden stool and folding her hands looked at Ben in a most despairing way x93I knowx94 said Ben x93we havent got muchx94 x93We havent got anythingx94 said Polly still looking at him x93Why weve got a treex94 replied Ben hopefully x93Well whats a treex94 retorted Polly scornfully x93Anybody can go out and look at a tree outdoorsx94 x93Well now I tell you Pollyx94 said Ben sitting down on the floor beside her and speaking very slowly and decisively x93weve got to do something cause weve begun; and we might make a tree real prettyx94 x93How?x94 asked Polly ashamed of her ill-humor but not in the least seeing how anything could be made of a tree x93How Ben Pepper?x94 x93Wellx94 said Ben pleasantly x93wed set it up in the corner--x94 x93Oh no not in the cornerx94 cried Polly whose spirits began to rise a little as she saw Ben so hopeful x93Put it in the middle of the room do!x94 x93I dont care where you put itx94 said Ben smiling happy that Pollys usual cheerful energy had returned x93but I thought--twill be a little one you know and I thought twould look better in the cornerx94 x93What else?x94 asked Polly eager to see how Ben would dress the tree x93Wellx94 said Ben x93you know the Henderson boys gave me a lot of corn last weekx94 x93I dont see as that helps muchx94 said Polly still incredulous x93Do you mean hang the cobs on the branches Ben? That would be just dreadful!x94 x93I should think likelyx94 laughed Ben x93No indeed Polly Pepper! but if we should pop a lot oh! a bushel and then we should string em we could wind it all in and out among the branches and--x94 x93Why wouldnt that be pretty?x94 cried Polly x93real pretty--and we can do that Im surex94 x93Yesx94 continued Ben; x93and then dont you know theres some little candle ends in that box in the Provision Room maybe mammyd give us themx94 x93I dont believe but she wouldx94 cried Polly; x93twould be just like Jappys if she would! Lets ask her now--this very same minute!x94 And they scampered hurriedly to Mrs Pepper who to their extreme astonishment after all said x93yesx94 and smiled encouragingly on the plan x93Isnt mammy good?x94 said Polly with loving gratitude as they seated themselves again x93Now were all rightx94 exclaimed Ben x93and I tell you we can make the tree look perfectly splendid Polly Pepper!x94 x93And Ill tell you another thing Benx94 Polly said x93oh! something elegant! You must get ever so many hickory nuts; and you know those bits of bright paper Ive got in the bureau drawer? Well we can paste them on to the nuts and hang em on for the balls Jappy tells ofx94 x93Pollyx94 cried Ben x93itll be such a tree as never was wont it?x94 x93Yes; but dear mex94 cried Polly springing up x93the children are coming! Wasnt it good grandma wanted em to come over this afternoon sos we could talk! Now hush!x94 as the door opened to admit the noisy little troop x93If you think of any new planx94 whispered Ben behind his hand while Mrs Pepper engaged their attention x93youll have to come out into the wood-shed to talk after thisx94 x93I know itx94 whispered Polly back again; x93oh! weve got just heaps of things to think of Bensie!x94 Such a contriving and racking of brains as Polly and Ben set up after this! They would bob over at each other and smile with significant gesture as a new idea would strike one of them in the most mysterious way that if observed would drive the others almost wild And then frightened lest in some hilarious moment the secret should pop out the two conspirators would betake themselves to the wood-shed as before agreed on But Joel finding this out followed them one day--or as Polly said tagged--so that was no good x93Lets go behind the wood-pilex94 she said to Ben in desperation; x93he cant hear there if we whisper real softx94 x93Yes he willx94 said Ben who knew Joels hearing faculties much better x93Well have to wait till theyre a-bedx94 So after that when nightfall first began to make its appearance Polly would hint mildly about bedtime x93You hustle us so!x94 said Joel after he had been sent off to bed for two or three nights unusually early x93Oh Joey its good for you to get to bedx94 said Polly coaxingly; x93itll make you grow you know real fastx94 x93Well I dont grow a-bedx94 grumbled Joel who thought something was in the wind x93You and Ben are going to talk I know and wink your eyes as soon as were gonex94 x93Well go along Joe thats a good boyx94 said Polly laughing x93and youll know some dayx94 x93Whatll you give me?x94 asked Joel seeing a bargain his foot on the lowest stair leading to the loft x93say Polly?x94 x93Oh I havent got much to givex94 she said cheerily; x93but Ill tell you what Joey--Ill tell you a story every day that you go to bedx94 x93Will you?x94 cried Joe hopping back into the room x93Begin now Polly begin now!x94 x93Why you havent been to bed yetx94 said Polly x93so I cant till to-morrowx94 x93Yes I have--youve made us go for three--no I guess fourteen nightsx94 said Joel indignantly x93Well you were made to gox94 laughed Polly x93I said if youd go good you know; so run along Joe and Ill tell you a nice one to-morrowx94 x93Its got to be longx94 shouted Joel when he saw he could get no more making good time up to the loft To say that Polly in the following days was Master Joels slave was stating the case lightly However she thought by her story-telling she got off easily as each evening saw the boys drag their unwilling feet to-bedward and leave Ben and herself in peace to plan and work undisturbed There they would sit by the little old table around the one tallow candle while Mrs Pepper sewed away busily looking up to smile or to give some bits of advice; keeping her own secret meanwhile which made her blood leap fast as the happy thoughts nestled in her heart of her little ones and their coming glee And Polly made the loveliest of paper dolls for Phronsie out of the rest of the bits of bright paper; and Ben made windmills and whistles for the boys; and a funny little carved basket with a handle for Phronsie out of a hickory nut shell; and a new pink calico dress for Seraphina peered out from the top drawer of the old bureau in the bedroom whenever anyone opened it--for Mrs Pepper kindly let the children lock up their treasures there as fast as completed x93Ill make Seraphina a bonnetx94 said Mrs Pepper x93for theres that old bonnet-string in the bag you know Polly thatll make it beautifulx94 x93Oh do motherx94 cried Polly x93shes been wanting a new one awfullyx94 x93And Im going to knit some mittens for Joel and Davidx94 continued Mrs Pepper; x93cause I can get the yarn cheap now I saw some down at the store yesterday I could have at half pricex94 x93I dont believe anybodyll have as good a Christmas as we shallx94 cried Polly pasting on a bit of trimming to the gayest dolls dress; x93no not even Jappyx94 An odd little smile played around Mrs Peppers mouth but she said not a word and so the fun and the work went on The tree was to be set up in the Provision Room; that was finally decided as Mrs Pepper showed the children how utterly useless it would be to try having it in the kitchen x93Ill find the key childrenx94 she said x93I think I know where tis and then we can keep them outx94 x93Well but it looks sox94 said Polly demurring at the prospect x93Oh no Pollyx94 said her mother; x93at any rate its cleanx94 x93Pollyx94 said Ben x93we can put evergreen around you knowx94 x93So we canx94 said Polly brightly; x93oh Ben you do think of the best things; we couldnt have had them in the kitchenx94 x93And dont lets hang the presents on the treex94 continued Ben; x93lets have the children hang up their stockings; they want to awfully--for I heard David tell Joel this morning before we got up--they thought I was asleep but I wasnt--that he did so wish they could but says he Dont tell mammy cause thatll make her feel badx94 x93The little dears!x94 said Mrs Pepper impulsively; x93they shall have their stockings toox94 x93And well make the tree pretty enoughx94 said Polly enthusiastically; x93we shant want the presents to hang on; weve got so many things And then well have hickory nuts to eat; and perhaps mammyll let us make some molasses candy the day beforex94 she said with a sly look at her mother x93You mayx94 said Mrs Pepper smiling x93Oh goody!x94 they both cried hugging each other ecstatically x93And well have a frolic in the Provision Room afterwardsx94 finished Polly; x93oh! ooh!x94 And so the weeks flew by--one two three four five six seven eight! till only the three days remained and to think the fun that Polly and Ben had had already! x93Its bettern a Christmasx94 they told their mother x93to get ready for it!x94 x93Its too bad you cant hang up your stockingsx94 said Mrs Pepper looking keenly at their flushed faces and bright eyes; x93youve never hung em upx94 x93That isnt any matter mamsiex94 they both said cheerily; x93its a great deal better to have the children have a nice time--oh wont it be elegant! praps well have ours next year!x94 For two days before the house was turned upside down for Joel to find the biggest stocking he could; but on Polly telling him it must be his own he stopped his search and bringing down his well-worn one hung it by the corner of the chimney to be ready x93You put yours up the other side Davex94 he advised x93There isnt any nailx94 cried David investigating x93Ill drive onex94 said Joel so he ran out to the tool-house as one corner of the wood-shed was called and brought in the hammer and one or two nails x93Phronsies a-goin in the middlex94 he said with a nail in his mouth x93Yes Im a-goin to hang up my stockinx94 cried the child hopping from one toe to the other x93Run get it Phronsiex94 said Joel x93and Ill hang it up for you x93Why its two days before Christmas yetx94 said Polly laughing; x93how theyll look hanging there so longx94 x93I dont carex94 said Joel giving a last thump to the nail; x93were a-goin to be ready Oh dear!

Santys coming!x94 sang Phronsie as the bright afternoon sunlight went down over the fresh crisp snow x93for its night nowx94 x93Yes Santa is coming!x94 sang Polly; and x93Santa Claus is comingx94 rang back and forth through the old kitchen till it seemed as if the three little old stockings would hop down and join in the dance going on so merrily x93Im glad mine is redx94 said Phronsie at last stopping in the wild jig and going up to see if it was all safe x93cause then Santyll know its mine wont he Polly?x94 x93Yes dearx94 cried Polly catching her up x93Oh Phronsie! you are going to have a Christmas!x94 x93Well I wishx94 said Joel x93I had my name on mine!

In the middle of the night Polly woke up with a start x93What in the world!x94 said she and she bobbed up her head and looked over at her mother who was still peacefully sleeping and was just going to lie down again when a second noise out in the kitchen made her pause and lean on her elbow to listen At this moment she thought she heard a faint whisper and springing out of bed she ran to Phronsies crib--it was empty! As quick as a flash she sped out into the kitchen There in front of the chimney were two figures One was Joel and the other unmistakably was Phronsie! x93What are you doing?x94 gasped Polly holding on to a chair The two little night-gowns turned around at this x93Why I thought it was morningx94 said Joel x93and I wanted my stocking Oh!x94 as he felt the toe which was generously stuffed x93give it to me Polly Pepper and Ill run right back to bed again!x94 x93Dear me!x94 said Polly; x93and you too Phronsie! Why its the middle of the night! Did I ever!x94 and she had to pinch her mouth together tight to keep from bursting out into a loud laugh x93Oh dear I shall laugh! dont look so scared Phronsie there wont anything hurt youx94 For Phronsie who on hearing Joel fumbling around the precious stockings had been quite willing to hop out of bed and join him had now on Pollys saying the dire words x93in the middle of the nightx94 scuttled over to her protecting side like a frightened rabbit x93It neverll be morningx94 said Joel taking up first one cold toe and then the other; x93you might let us have em now Pollyx94 x93Nox94 said Polly sobering down; x93you cant have yours till Davie wakes up too Scamper off to bed Joey dear and forget all about em--and itll be morning before you know itx94 x93Oh Id rather go to bedx94 said Phronsie trying to tuck up her feet in the little flannel night-gown which was rather short x93but I dont know the way back Polly Take me Polly dox94 and she put up her arms to be carried x93Oh I aint a-goin back alone eitherx94 whimpered Joel coming up to Polly too x93Why you came down alone didnt you?x94 whispered Polly with a little laugh x93Yes but I thought twas morningx94 said Joel his teeth chattering with something beside the cold x93Well you must think of the morning thats comingx94 said Polly cheerily x93Ill tell you--you wait till I put Phronsie into the crib and then Ill come back and go half-way up the stairs with youx94 x93I wont never come down till its mornin againx94 said Joel bouncing along the stairs when Polly was ready to go with him at a great rate x93Better notx94 laughed Polly softly x93Be careful and not wake Davie nor Benx94 x93Im inx94 announced Joel in a loud whisper; and Polly could hear him snuggle down among the warm bedclothes x93Call us when tis mornin Pollyx94 x93Yesx94 said Polly x93I will; go to sleepx94 Phronsie had forgotten stockings and everything else on Pollys return and was fast asleep in the old crib The result of it was that the children slept over when morning did really come; and Polly had to keep her promise and go to the foot of the stairs and call--x93MERRY CHRISTMAS! oh Ben! and Joel! and Davie!x94 x93Oh!--oh!--oo-h!x94 and then the sounds that answered her as with smothered whoops of expectation they one and all flew into their clothes! Quick as a flash Joel and Davie were down and dancing around the chimney x93Mammy! mammy!x94 screamed Phronsie hugging her stocking which Ben lifted her up to unhook from the big nail x93Santy did come he did!x94 and then she spun around in the middle of the floor not stopping to look in it x93Well open it Phronsiex94 called Davie deep in the exploring of his own; x93oh! isnt that a splendid wind-mill Joe?x94 x93Yesx94 said that individual who having found a big piece of molasses candy was so engaged in enjoying a huge bite that regardless alike of his other gifts or of the smearing his face was getting he gave himself wholly up to its delights x93Oh Joeyx94 cried Polly laughingly x93molasses candy for breakfast!x94 x93Thats prime!x94 cried Joel swallowing the last morsel x93Now Im going to see whats this--oh Dave see here! see here!x94 he cried in intense excitement pulling out a nice little parcel which unrolled proved to be a bright pair of stout mittens x93See if youve got some--look quick!x94 x93Yes I havex94 said David picking up a parcel about as big x93No thats molasses candyx94 x93Just the same as I hadx94 said Joel; x93do look for the mittens Praps Santa Claus thought you had some--oh dear!x94 x93Here they are!x94 screamed Davie x93I have got some Joe just exactly like yours! See Joe!x94 x93Goody!x94 said Joel immensely relieved; for now he could quite enjoy his to see a pair on Davies hands also x93Look at Phronx94 he cried x93she hasnt got only half of her things out!x94 To tell the truth Phronsie was so bewildered by her riches that she sat on the floor with the little red stocking in her lap laughing and cooing to herself amid the few things she had drawn out When she came to Seraphinas bonnet she was quite overcome She turned it over and over and smoothed out the little white feather that had once adorned one of Grandma Bascoms chickens until the two boys with their stockings and the others sitting around in a group on the floor watching them laughed in glee to see her enjoyment x93Oh dearx94 said Joel at last shaking his stocking; x93Ive got all there is I wish there were forty Christmases coming!x94 x93I havent!x94 screamed Davie; x93theres some thing in the toex94 x93Its an apple I guessx94 said Joel; x93turn it up Davex94 x93Tisnt an applex94 exclaimed Davie x93tisnt round--its long and thin; here tisx94 And he pulled out a splendid long whistle on which he blew a blast long and terrible and Joel immediately following all quiet was broken up and the wildest hilarity reigned x93I dont know as youll want any breakfastx94 at last said Mrs Pepper when she had got Phronsie a little sobered down x93I do I do!x94 cried Joel x93Dear me! after your candy?x94 said Polly x93Thats all gonex94 said Joel tooting around the table on his whistle x93What are we going to have for breakfast?x94 x93Same as everx94 said his mother; x93it cant be Christmas all the timex94 x93I wish twasx94 said little Davie; x93forever and ever!x94 x93Forever an everx94 echoed little Phronsie flying up her cheeks like two pinks and Seraphina in her arms with her bonnet on upside down x93Dear dearx94 said Polly pinching Ben to keep still as they tumbled down the little rickety steps to the Provision Room after breakfast The children content in their treasures were holding high carnival in the kitchen x93Suppose they should find it out now--I declare I should feel most awfully Isnt it elegant?x94 she asked in a subdued whisper going all around and around the tree magnificent in its dress of bright red and yellow balls white festoons and little candle-ends all ready for lighting x93Oh Ben did you lock the door?x94 x93Yesx94 he said x93Thats a mousex94 he added as a little rustling noise made Polly stop where she stood back of the tree and prick up her ears in great distress of mind x93Tis elegantx94 he said turning around in admiration and taking in the tree which as Polly said was quite x93gorgeousx94 and the evergreen branches twisted up on the beams and rafters and all the other festive arrangements x93Even Jappys isnt better I dont believe!x94 x93I wish Jappy was herex94 said Polly with a small sigh x93Well he isntx94 said Ben; x93come we must go back into the kitchen or all the children will be out here Look your last Polly; twont do to come again till its time to light upx94 x93Mammy says shed rather do the lighting upx94 said Polly x93Had she?x94 said Ben in surprise; x93oh I suppose shes afraid well set somethin a-fire Well then we shant come in till we have itx94 x93I cant bear to gox94 said Polly turning reluctantly away; x93its most beautiful--oh Benx94 and she faced him for the five-hundredth time with the question x93is your Santa Claus dress all safe?x94 x93Yesx94 said Ben x93Ill warrant they wont find that in one hurry! Such a time as weve had to make it!x94 x93I know itx94 laughed Polly; x93dont that cotton wool look just like bits of fur Ben?x94 x93Yesx94 said Ben x93and when the flours shaken over me itll be Santa himselfx94 x93Weve got to put back the hair into mamsies cushion the first thing to-morrowx94 whispered Polly anxiously x93and we mustnt forget it Bensiex94 x93I want to keep the wig awfullyx94 said Ben x93You did make that just magnificent Polly!x94 x93If you could see yourselfx94 giggled Polly; x93did you put it in the straw bed? and are you sure you pulled the ticking over it smooth?x94 x93Yes sirx94 replied Ben x93sures my names Ben Pepper! if youll only keep them from seeing me when Im in it till were ready--thats all I askx94 x93Wellx94 said Polly a little relieved x93but I hope Joe wont lookx94 x93Come on! theyre a-comin!x94 whispered Ben; x93quick!x94 x93Polly!x94 rang a voice dangerously near; so near that Polly speeding over the stairs to intercept it nearly fell on her nose x93Where you been?x94 asked one x93Lets have a concertx94 put in Ben; Polly was so out of breath that she couldnt speak x93Come now each take a whistle and well march round and round and see which can make the biggest noisex94 In the rattle and laughter which this procession made all mystery was forgotten and the two conspirators began to breathe freer Five oclock! The small ones of the Pepper flock being pretty well tired out with noise and excitement all gathered around Polly and Ben and clamored for a story x93Do Polly dox94 begged Joel x93Its Christmas and twont come again for a yearx94 x93I cantx94 said Polly in such a twitter that she could hardly stand still and for the first time in her life refusing x93I cant think of a thingx94 x93I will thenx94 said Ben; x93we must do somethingx94 he whispered to Polly x93Tell it goodx94 said Joel settling himself So for an hour the small tyrants kept their entertainers well employed x93Isnt it growing awful dark?x94 said Davie rousing himself at last as Ben paused to take breath Polly pinched Ben x93Mammys a-goin to let us knowx94 he whispered in reply x93We must keep on a little longerx94 x93Dont stopx94 said Joel lifting his head where he sat on the floor x93What you whisperin for Polly?x94 x93Im notx94 said Polly glad to think she hadnt spoken x93Well do go on Benx94 said Joel lying down again x93Pollyll have to finish itx94 said Ben; x93Ive got to go upstairs nowx94 So Polly launched out into such an extravagant story that they all perforce had to listen All this time Mrs Pepper had been pretty busy in her way And now she came into the kitchen and set down her candle on the table x93Childrenx94 she said Everybody turned and looked at her--her tone was so strange; and when they saw her dark eyes shining with such a new light little Davie skipped right out into the middle of the room x93Whats the matter mammy?x94 x93You may all come into the Provision Roomx94 said she x93What for?x94 shouted Joel in amazement; while the others jumped to their feet and stood staring Polly flew around like a general arranging her forces x93Lets march therex94 said she; x93Phronsie you take hold of Davies hand and go firstx94 x93Im goin firstx94 announced Joel squeezing up past Polly x93No you mustnt Joex94 said Polly decidedly; x93Phronsie and David are the youngestx94 x93Theyre always the youngestx94 said Joel falling back with Polly to the rear x93Forward! MARCH!x94 sang Polly x93Follow mamsie!x94 Down the stairs they went with military step and into the Provision Room And then with one wild look the little battalion broke ranks and tumbling one over the other in decidedly unmilitary style presented a very queer appearance! And Captain Polly was the queerest of all; for she just gave one gaze at the tree and then sat right down on the floor and said x93Oh! OH!x94 Mrs Pepper was flying around delightedly and saying x93Please to come right inx94 and x93How do you do?x94 And before anybody knew it there were the laughing faces of Mrs Henderson and the Parson himself Doctor Fisher and old Grandma Bascom; while the two Henderson boys unwilling to be defrauded of any of the fun were squeezing themselves in between everybody else and coming up to Polly every third minute and saying x93There--arent you surprised?x94 x93Its Fairyland!x94 cried little Davie out of his wits with joy; x93Oh! arent we in Fairyland ma?x94 The whole room was in one buzz of chatter and fun; and everybody beamed on everybody else; and nobody knew what they said till Mrs Pepper called x93Hush! Santa Claus is coming!x94 A rattle at the little old window made everybody look there just as a great snow-white head popped up over the sill x93Oh!x94 screamed Joel x93tis Santy!x94 x93Hes a-comin in!x94 cried Davie in chorus which sent Phronsie flying to Polly In jumped a little old man quite spry for his years; with a jolly red face and a pack on his back and flew into their midst prepared to do his duty; but what should he do instead of making his speech x93this jolly Old Saint--x94 but first fly up to Mrs Pepper and say--x93Oh mammy how did you do it?x94 x93Its Ben!x94 screamed Phronsie; but the little Old Saint didnt hear for he and Polly took hold of hands and pranced around that tree while everybody laughed till they cried to see them go! And then it all came out! x93Order!x94 said Parson Henderson in his deepest tones; and then he put into Santa Claus hands a letter which he requested him to read And the jolly Old Saint although he was very old didnt need any spectacles but piped out in Bens loudest tones x93Dear Friends--A Merry Christmas to you all! And that youll have a good time and enjoy it all as much as Ive enjoyed my good times at your house is the wish of your friend x93JASPER ELYOT KINGx94 x93Hurrah for Jappy!x94 cried Santa Claus pulling his beard; and x93Hurrah for Jasper!x94 went all around the room; and this ended in three good cheers--Phronsie coming in too late with her little crow--which was just as well however! x93Do your duty now Santa Claus!x94 commanded Dr Fisher as master of ceremonies; and everything was as still as a mouse! And the first thing she knew a lovely brass cage with a dear little bird with two astonished black eyes dropped down into Pollys hands The card on it said x93For Miss Polly Pepper to give her music everyday in the yearx94 x93Mammyx94 said Polly; and then she did the queerest thing of the whole! she just burst into tears! x93I never thought I should have a bird for my very own!x94 x93Hulloa!x94 said Santa Claus x93Ive got something myself!x94 x93Santa Claus clothes are too oldx94 laughed Dr Fisher holding up a stout warm suit that a boy about as big as Ben would delight in And then that wonderful tree just rained down all manner of lovely fruit Gifts came flying thick and fast till the air seemed full and each one was greeted with a shout of glee as it was put into the hands of its owner A shawl flew down on Mrs Peppers shoulders; and a work-basket tumbled on Pollys head; and tops and balls and fishing poles sent Joel and David into a corner with howls of delight! But the climax was reached when a large wax doll in a very gay pink silk dress was put into Phronsies hands and Dr Fisher stooping down read in loud tones x93FOR PHRONSIE FROM ONE WHO ENJOYED HER GINGERBREAD BOYx94 After that nobody had anything to say! Books jumped down unnoticed and gay boxes of candy Only Polly peeped into one of her books and saw in Jappys plain hand--x93I hope well both read this next summerx94 And turning over to the title-page she saw x93A Complete Manual of Cookeryx94 x93The best is to comex94 said Mrs Henderson in her gentle way When there was a lull in the gale she took Pollys hand and led her to a little stand of flowers in the corner concealed by a sheet--pinks and geraniums heliotropes and roses blooming away and nodding their pretty heads at the happy sight--Polly had her flowers x93Why didnt we know?x94 cried the children at last when everybody was tying on their hoods and getting their hats to leave the festive scene x93how could you keep it secret mammy?x94 x93They all went to Mrs Hendersonsx94 said Mrs Pepper; x93Jasper wrote me and asked where to send em and Mrs Henderson was so kind as to say that they might come there And we brought em over last evening when you were all abed I couldnt have done itx94 she said bowing to the Parson and his wife x93if twasnt for their kindness--never in all this world!x94 x93And Im surex94 said the minister looking around on the bright group x93if we can help along a bit of happiness like this it is a blessed thing!x94 And here Joel had the last word x93You said twant goin to be Christmas always mammy I sayx94 looking around on the overflow of treasures and the happy faces--x93itll be just forever!x94 EDUCATION AHEAD After that they couldnt thank Jasper enough! They tried to lovingly and an elaborate letter of thanks headed by Mrs Pepper was drawn up and sent with a box of the results of Pollys diligent study of Jaspers book Polly stripped off recklessly her choicest buds and blossoms from the gay little stand of flowers in the corner that had already begun to blossom and tucked them into every little nook in the box that could possibly hold a posy But as for thanking him enough! x93We cant do it mammyx94 said Polly looking around on all the happy faces and then up at Cherry who was singing in the window and who immediately swelled up his little throat and poured out such a merry burst of song that she had to wait for him to finish x93No not if we tried a thousand years!x94 x93Im a-goinx94 said Joel who was busy as a bee with his new tools that the tree had shaken down for him x93to make Jappy the splendidest box you ever saw Polly! I guess thatll thank him!x94 x93Dox94 cried Polly; x93hed be so pleased Joeyx94 x93And Ix94 said Phronsie over in the corner with her children x93Im goin to see my poor sick man sometime Polly I am!x94 x93Oh dear!x94 cried Polly whirling around and looking at her mother in dismay x93Shell be goin to-morrow! Oh no Phronsie you cant; he lives miles and miles away--oh ever so far!x94 x93Does he live as far as the moon?x94 asked little Phronsie carefully laying Seraphina down and looking up at Polly anxiously x93Oh I dont knowx94 said Polly giving Cherry a piece of bread and laughing to see how cunning he looked x93Oh no of course not but its an awful long ways Phronsiex94 x93I dont carex94 said Phronsie determinedly giving the new doll a loving little pat x93Im goin sometime Polly to thank my poor sick man yes I am!x94 x93Youll see him next summer Phronsiex94 sang Polly skipping around the kitchen x93and Jappys sister Marian the lovely lady and all the boys Wont that be nice?x94 and Polly stopped to pat the yellow head bending in motherly attentions over her array of dolls x93Ye-esx94 said Phronsie slowly; x93the whole of em Polly?x94 x93Yes indeed!x94 said Polly gayly; x93the whole of em Phronsie! x93Hooray!x94 shouted the two boys while Phronsie only gave a long sigh and clasped her hands x93Better not be looking for summerx94 said Mrs Pepper x93until you do your duty by the winter; then you can enjoy itx94 and she took a fresh needleful of thread x93Mamsies rightx94 said Ben smiling over at her And he threw down his book and jumped for his cap x93Now for a good chop!x94 he cried and snatching a kiss from Phronsie he rushed out of the door to his work whistling as he went x93Warnt Mr Henderson good max94 asked Polly watching his retreating figure x93to give Ben learning?x94 x93Yes he wasx94 replied Mrs Pepper enthusiastically x93Weve got a parson if anybody has in this world!x94 x93And Bens learningx94 said Polly swelling with pride as she sat down by her mother and began to sew rapidly x93so that hell be a big man right off! Oh dearx94 as a thought made her needle pause a minute in its quick flying in and out x93What is it Polly?x94 Mrs Pepper looked keenly at the troubled face and downcast eyes x93Why--x94 began Polly and then she finished very slowly x93I shant know anything and Benll be ashamed of me x93Yes you will!x94 cried Mrs Pepper energetically x93you keep on trying and the Lordll send some way; dont you go to bothering your head about it now Polly--itll come when its timex94 x93Will it?x94 asked Polly doubtfully taking up her needle again x93Yes indeed!x94 cried Mrs Pepper briskly; x93come fly at your sewing; thats your learning nowx94 x93So tisx94 said Polly with a little laugh x93Now lets see whichll get their seam done first mamsie?x94 And now letters flew thick and fast from the city to the little brown house and back again warming Jaspers heart and filling the tedious months of that winter with more of jollity and fun than the lad ever enjoyed before; and never was fun and jollity more needed than now; for Mr King having nothing to do and each year finding himself less inclined to exercise any thoughtful energy for others began to look at life something in the light of a serious bore and accordingly made it decidedly disagreeable for all around him and particularly for Jasper who was his constant companion But the boy was looking forward to summer and so held on bravely x93I do verily believe Pollyx94 he wrote x93that Badgertownll see the gayest times it ever knew! Sister Marian wants to go so thats all right Now hurrah for a good time--its surely coming!x94 But alas! for Jasper! as spring advanced his father took a decided aversion to Hingham Badgertown and all other places that could be mentioned in that vicinity x93Its a wretched climatex94 he asserted over and over; x93and the foundation of all my ill feelings this winter was laid Im convinced in Hingham last summerx94 No use to urge the contrary; and all Jaspers pleadings were equally vain At last sister Marian who was kind-hearted to a fault sorry to see her brothers dismay and disappointment said one day x93Why not have one of the children come here? I should like it very much--do invite Benx94 x93I dont want Benx94 said Jasper gloomily x93I want Pollyx94 He added this in much the same tone as Phronsies when she had rushed up to him the day she was lost declaring x93I want Polly!x94 x93Very well thenx94 said sister Marian laughing x93Im sure I didnt mean to dictate which one; let it be Polly then; yes I should prefer Polly myself I think as weve enough boys nowx94 smiling to think of her own brood of wide awake youngsters x93If you only will father Ill try to be ever so good!x94 said Jasper turning suddenly to his father x93Jasper needs some changex94 said sister Marian kindly x93he really has grown very pale and thinx94 x93Hey!x94 said Mr King sharply looking at him over his eyeglasses x93The boys well enough; well enough!x94 But he twisted uneasily in his chair all the same At last he flung down his paper twitched his fingers through his hair two or three times and then burst out--x93Well why dont you send for her? Im sure I dont care--Ill write myself and I had better do it now Tell Thomas to be ready to take it right down; it must get into this mailx94 When Mr King had made up his mind to do anything everybody else must immediately give up their individual plans and stand out of the way for him to execute his at just that particular moment! Accordingly Thomas was dragged from his work to post the letter while the old gentleman occupied the time in pulling out his watch every third second until the slightly-out-of-breath Thomas reported on his return that the letter did get in Then Mr King settled down satisfied and everything went on smoothly as before But Polly didnt come! A grateful appreciative letter expressed in Mrs Peppers own stiff way plainly showed the determination of that good woman not to accept what was such a favor to her child In vain Mr King stormed and fretted and begged offering every advantage possible--Polly should have the best foundation for a musical education that the city could afford; also lessons in the schoolroom under the boys private tutor--it was all of no avail In vain sister Marian sent a gentle appeal fully showing her heart was in it; nothing broke down Mrs Peppers resolve until at last the old gentleman wrote one day that Jasper being in such failing health really depended on Polly to cheer him up That removed the last straw that made it x93putting ones self under an obligationx94 which to Mrs Peppers independent soul had seemed insurmountable And now it was decided that Polly was really to go! and pretty soon all Badgertown knew that Polly Pepper was going to the big city And there wasnt a man woman or child but what greatly rejoiced that a sunny time was coming to one of the chicks in the little brown house With many warm words and some substantial gifts kind friends helped forward the x93outingx94 Only one person doubted that this delightful chance should be grasped at once--and that one was Polly herself! x93I cantx94 she said and stood quite pale and still when the Hendersons advised her mothers approval and even Grandma Bascom said x93Gox94 x93I cant go and leave mammy to do all the workx94 x93But dont you see Pollyx94 said Mrs Henderson drawing her to her side x93that you will help your mother twice as much as you possibly could here by getting a good education? Think what your music will be; only think Polly!x94 Polly drew a long breath at this and turned away x93Oh Polly!x94 cried Ben though his voice choked x93if you give this up there neverll be another chancex94 and the boy put his arm around her and whispered something in her ear x93I knowx94 said Polly quietly--and then she burst out x93oh but I cant! tisnt rightx94 x93Pollyx94 said Mrs Pepper--and never in all their lives had the children seen such a look in mamsies eyes as met them then; x93it does seem as if my heart would be broken if you didnt go!x94 And then she burst out crying right before them all! x93Oh mammyx94 cried Polly breaking away from everybody and flinging herself into her arms x93Ill go--if you think I ought to But its too good! dont cry--dont mammy dearx94 and Polly stroked the careworn face lovingly and patted the smooth hair that was still so black x93And Pollyx94 said Mrs Pepper smiling through her tears x93just think what a comfort youll be to me and us allx94 she added taking in the children who were crowding around Polly as the centre of attraction x93Why youll be the making of usx94 she added hopefully x93Ill do somethingx94 said Polly her brown eyes kindling x93or I shant be worthy of you mammyx94 x93O youll do itx94 said Mrs Pepper confidently x93now that youre goingx94 But when Polly stepped into the stage with her little hair trunk strapped on behind containing her one brown merino that Mrs Henderson had made over for her out of one of her own and her two new ginghams her courage failed again and she astonished everybody and nearly upset a mild-faced old lady who was in the corner placidly eating doughnuts by springing out and rushing up through the little brown gate past all the family drawn up to see her off She flew over the old flat door-stone and into the bedroom where she flung herself down between the old bed and Phronsies crib in a sudden torrent of tears x93I cant go!x94 she sobbed--x93oh I cant!x94 x93Why Polly!x94 cried Mrs Pepper hurrying in followed by Joel and the rest of the troops at his heels x93What are you thinking of!x94 x93Think of by-and-by Pollyx94 put in Ben patting her on the back with an unsteady hand while Joel varied the proceedings by running back and forth screaming at the top of his lungs x93The stages going! your trunkll be taken!x94 x93Dear me!x94 ejaculated Mrs Pepper x93do stop it somebody! there Polly come now! Do as mother says!x94 x93Ill try againx94 said poor Polly choking back her sobs and getting on her feet Then Pollys tears were wiped away her hat straightened after which she was kissed all round again by the whole family Phronsie waiting for the last two and then was helped again into the stage the bags and parcels and a box for Jappy which as it wouldnt go into the trunk Joel had insisted Polly should carry in her hand were again piled around her and Mr Tisbett mounted to his seat and with a crack of the whip bore her safely off this time The doughnut lady viewing poor Polly with extreme sympathy immediately forced upon her acceptance three of the largest and sugariest x93Twill do you goodx94 she said falling to herself on another with good zeal x93I always eat em and then there aint any room for homesickness!x94 And away and away and away they rumbled and jumbled to the cars Here Mr Tisbett put Polly and her numerous bundles under the care of the conductor with manifold charges and explicit directions to see her safely into Mr Kings own hands He left her sitting straight up among her parcels her sturdy little figure drawn up to its full height and the clear brown eyes regaining a little of their dancing light; for although a dreadful feeling tugged at her heart as she thought of the little brown house she was fast flying away from there was something else; our Polly had begun to realize that now she was going to x93help motherx94 And now they neared the big city and everybody began to bustle around and get ready to jump out and the minute the train stopped the crowd poured out from the cars making way for the crowd pouring in for this was a through train x93All aboard!x94 sang the conductor x93Oh my senses!x94 springing to Polly; x93I forgot you--here!x94 But as quick as a flash he was pushed aside and a bright boyish figure dashed up x93Oh Polly!x94 he said in such a ringing voice! and in another second Polly and her bag and the bundle of cakes and apples that Grandma Bascom had put up for her and Joels box were one and all bundled out upon the platform and the train whizzed on and there Mr King was fuming up and down berating the departing conductor and speaking his mind in regard to all the railroad officials he could think of He pulled himself up long enough to give Polly a hearty welcome; and then away again he flew in righteous indignation while Jasper rushed off into the baggage room with Pollys check However every now and then turning to look down into the little rosy face beside him the old gentleman would burst forth x93Bless me child! Im glad youre here Polly!--how could the fellow forget when--x94 x93Oh well you knowx94 said Polly with a happy little wriggle under her brown coat x93Im here nowx94 x93So you are! so you are!x94 laughed the old gentleman suddenly; x93where can Jasper be so longx94 x93Theyre all in the carriagex94 answered the boy skipping back x93Now father! now Polly!x94 He was fairly bubbling over with joy and Mr King forgot his dudgeon and joined in the general glee which soon became so great that travellers gave many a glance at the merry trio who bundled away to Thomas and the waiting grays x93Youre sure youve got the right check?x94 asked Mr King nervously getting into a handsome coach lined with dark green satin and settling down among its ample cushions with a sigh of relief x93Oh yesx94 laughed Jasper; x93Polly didnt have any one elses check I guessx94 Over through the heart of the city down narrow noisy business streets out into wide avenues with handsome stately mansions on either side--they flew along x93Ohx94 said Polly; and then she stopped and blushed very hard x93What is it my dear?x94 asked Mr King kindly Polly couldnt speak at first but when Jasper stopped his merry chat and begged to know what it was she turned on him and burst out x93You live here?x94 x93Why yesx94 laughed the boy; x93why not?x94 x93Oh!x94 said Polly again her cheeks as red as two roses x93its so lovely!x94 And then the carriage turned in at a brown stone gateway and winding up among some fine old trees stopped before a large stately residence that in Pollys eyes seemed like one of the castles of Bens famous stories And then Mr King got out and gallantly escorted Polly out and up the steps while Jasper followed with Pollys bag which he couldnt be persuaded to resign to Thomas A stiff waiter held the door open--and then the rest was only a pleasant confused jumble of kind welcoming words smiling faces with a background of high spacious walls bright pictures and soft elegant hangings everything and all inextricably mixed--till Polly herself seemed floating--away--away fast to the Fairyland of her dreams; now Mr King was handing her around like a precious parcel from one to the other--now Jasper was bobbing in and out everywhere introducing her on all sides and then Prince was jumping up and trying to lick her face every minute--but best of all was when a lovely face looked down into hers and Jaspers sister bent to kiss her x93I am very glad to have you here little Pollyx94 The words were simple but Polly lifting up her clear brown eyes looked straight into the heart of the speaker and from that moment never ceased to love her x93It was a good inspiratonx94 thought Mrs Whitney to herself; x93this little girl is going to be a comfort I knowx94 And then she set herself to conduct successfully her three boys into friendliness and good fellowship with Polly for each of them was following his own sweet will in the capacity of host and besides staring at her with all his might was determined to do the whole of the entertaining a state of things which might become unpleasant However Polly stood it like a veteran x93This little girl must be very tiredx94 said Mrs Whitney at last with a bright smile x93Besides I am going to have her to myself nowx94 x93Oh no nox94 cried little Dick in alarm; x93why shes just come; we want to see herx94 x93For shame Dick!x94 said Percy the eldest a boy of ten years who took every opportunity to reprove Dick in public; x93shes come a great ways so she ought to rest you knowx94 x93You wanted her to come out to the greenhouse yourself you know you didx94 put in Van the next to Percy who never would be reproved or patronized x93only she wouldnt gox94 x93Youll come down to dinnerx94 said Percy politely ignoring Van x93Then you wont be tired perhapsx94 x93Oh Im not very tired nowx94 said Polly brightly with a merry little laugh x93only Ive never been in the cars before and--x94 x93Never been in the cars before!x94 exclaimed Van crowding up while Percy made a big round O with his mouth and little Dicks eyes stretched to their widest extent x93Nox94 said Polly simply x93never in all my lifex94 x93Come dearx94 said sister Marian rising quickly and taking Pollys hand; while Jasper showing unmistakable symptoms of pitching into all the three boys followed with the bag Up the broad oak staircase they went Polly holding by Mrs Whitneys soft hand as if for dear life and Jasper tripping up two steps at a time in front of them They turned after reaching the top down a hall soft to the foot and brightly lighted x93Now Pollyx94 said sister Marian x93Im going to have you here right next to my dressing room; this is your nest little bird and I hope youll be very happy in itx94 And here Mrs Whitney turned up the gas and then just because she couldnt help it gathered Polly up in her arms without another word Jasper set down the bag on a chair and came and stood by his sisters side looking down at her as she stroked the brown wavy hair on her bosom x93Its so nice to have Polly here sisterx94 he said and he put his hand on Mrs Whitneys neck; and then with the other hand took hold of both of Pollys chubby ones who looked up and smiled; and in that smile the little brown house seemed to hop right out and bring back in a flash all the nice times those eight happy weeks had brought him x93Oh twas so perfectly splendid sister Marianx94 he cried flinging himself down on the floor by her chair x93You dont know what good times we had--does she Polly?x94 and then he launched out into a perfect shower of x93Dont you remember this?x94 or x93Oh Polly! you surely havent forgotten that!x94 Mrs Whitney good naturedly entering into it and enjoying it all with them until warned by the lateness of the hour she laughingly reminded Jasper of dinner and dismissed him to prepare for it When the three boys saw Polly coming in again they welcomed her with a cordial shout for one and all after careful measurement of her had succumbed entirely to Polly; and each was unwilling that the others should get ahead of him in her regard x93This is your seat Pollyx94 said sister Marian touching the chair next to her own Thereupon a small fight ensued between the little Whitneys while Jasper looked decidedly discomfited x93Let Polly sit next to mex94 said Van as if a seat next to him was of all things most to be desired x93Oh no I want herx94 said little Dick x93Pshaw Dick! youre too youngx94 put in Percy x93Youd spill the bread and butter all over herx94 x93I wouldnt eitherx94 said little Dick indignantly and beginning to crawl into his seat; x93I dont spill bread and butter now Percy you knowx94 x93See herex94 said Jasper decidedly x93shes coming up here by father and me; that is sister Marianx94 he finished more politely x93if youre willingx94 All this while Polly had stood quietly watching the group the big handsome table the bright lights and the well-trained servants with a curious feeling at her heart--what were the little-brown-house-people doing? x93Polly shall decide itx94 said sister Marian laughing x93Now where will you sit dear?x94 she added looking down on the little quiet figure beside her x93Oh by Jappy pleasex94 said Polly quickly as if there could be no doubt; x93and kind Mr Kingx94 she added smiling at him x93Thats right; thats right my dearx94 cried the old gentleman pleased beyond measure at her honest choice And he pulled out her chair and waited upon her into it so handsomely that Polly was happy at once; while Jasper with a proud toss of his dark wavy hair marched up delightedly and took the chair on her other side And now in two or three minutes it seemed as if Polly had always been there; it was the most natural thing in the world that sister Marian should smile down the table at the bright-faced narrator who answered all their numerous questions and entertained them all with accounts of Bens skill of Phronsies cunning ways of the boys who made fun for all and above everything else of the dear mother whom they all longed to help and of all the sayings and doings in the little brown house No wonder that the little boys forgot to eat; and for once never thought of the attractions of the table And when as they left the table at last little Dick rushed impulsively up to Polly and flinging himself into her arms declared x93I love you!--and youre my sister!x94 Nothing more was needed to make Polly feel at home x93Yesx94 said Mrs Whitney and nodded to herself in the saying x93it was a good thing; and a comfort I believe has come to this house this day!x94 BRAVE WORK AND THE REWARD And on the very first morrow came Pollys music teacher! The big drawing-room with its shaded light and draped furniture with its thick soft carpet on which no foot-fall could be heard with all its beauty and loveliness on every side was nothing to Pollys eyes only the room that contained the piano! That was all she saw! And when the teacher came he was simply the Fairy (an ugly little one it is true but still a most powerful being) who was to unlock its mysteries and conduct her into Fairyland itself He was a homely little Frenchman with a long curved nose and an enormous black moustache magnificently waxed who bowed elaborately and called her x93Mademoiselle Pep-paire;x94 but he had music in his soul and Polly couldnt reverence him too much And now the big piano gave out new sounds; sounds that told of a strong purpose and steady patience Every note was struck for mother and the home brood Monsieur Tourtelotte after watching her keenly out of his little black eyes would nod to himself like a mandarin and the nod would be followed by showers of extra politeness as his appreciation of her patient energy and attention Every chance she could get Polly would steal away into the drawing-room from Jappy and the three boys and all the attractions they could offer and laboriously work away over and over at the tedious scales and exercises that were to be stepping-stones to so much that was glorious beyond Never had she sat still for so long a time in her active little life; and now with her arms at just such an angle with the stiff chubby fingers kept under training and restraint--well Polly realized years after that only her love of the little brown house could ever have kept her from flying up and spinning around in perfect despair x93She likes it!x94 said Percy in absolute astonishment one day when Polly had refused to go out driving with all the other children in the park and had gone resolutely instead into the drawing-room and shut the door x93She likes those hateful old exercises and she dont like anything elsex94 x93Much you know about itx94 said Jappy; x93shes perfectly aching to go now Percy Whitney!x94 x93Well why dont she then?x94 said Percy opening his eyes to their widest extent x93Causex94 said Jasper stopping on his way to the door to look him full in the face x93shes commenced to learn to play and there wont anything stop herx94 x93Im going to tryx94 said Percy gleefully x93I know lots of ways I can do to try anywayx94 x93See here nowx94 said Jasper turning back x93you let her alone! Do you hear?x94 he added and there must have been something in his eye to command attention for Percy instantly signified his intention not to tease this young music student in the least x93Come on then old fellowx94 and Jasper swung his cap on his head x93Thomas will be like forty bears if we keep him waiting much longerx94 And Polly kept at it steadily day after day; getting through with the lessons in the schoolroom as quickly as possible to rush to her music until presently the little Frenchman waxed enthusiastic to that degree that as day after day progressed and swelled into weeks and each lesson came to an end he would skip away on the tips of his toes his nose in the air and the waxed ends of his moustache fairly trembling with delight x93Ah such patience as Mademoiselle Pep-paire has! I know no other such little Americane!x94 x93I thinkx94 said Jasper one evening after dinner when all the children were assembled as usual in their favorite place on the big rug in front of the fire in the library Prince in the middle of the group his head on his paws watching everything in infinite satisfaction x93that Pollys getting on in music as I never saw anyone do; and thats a fact!x94 x93I mean to beginx94 said Van ambitiously sitting up straight and staring at the glowing coals x93I guess I will to-morrowx94 which announcement was received with a perfect shout--Vans taste being anything rather than of a musical nature x93If you dox94 said Jappy when the merriment had a little subsided x93I shall go out of the house at every lesson; there wont anyone stay in it Vanx94 x93I can bang all I want to thenx94 said Van noways disturbed by the reflection and pulling one of Princes long ears x93you think youre so big Jappy just because youre thirteenx94 x93Hes only three ahead of me Vanx94 bristled Percy who never could forgive Jappy for being his uncle much less the still greater sin of having been born three years earlier than himself x93Threes just as bad as fourx94 said Van x93Lets tell storiesx94 began Polly who never could remember such goings on in the little brown house; x93we must each tell onex94 she added with the greatest enthusiasm x93and see which will be the biggest and the bestx94 x93Oh nox94 said Van who perfectly revelled in Pollys stories and who now forgot his trials in the prospect of one x93You tell Polly--you tell alonex94 x93Yes do Pollyx94 said Jasper; x93wed ratherx94 So Polly launched out into one of her gayest and finest; and soon they were in such a peal of laughter and had reached such heights of enjoyment that Mr King popped his head in at the door and then came in and took a seat in a big rocking-chair in the corner to hear the fun go on x93Oh dearx94 said Van leaning back with a long sigh and wiping his flushed face as Polly wound up with a triumphant flourish how ever do you think of such things Polly Pepper? x93That isnt anythingx94 said Jappy bringing his handsome face out into the strong light; x93why its just nothing to what she has told time and again in the little brown house in Badgertown;x94 and then he caught sight of Pollys face which turned a little pale in the firelight as he spoke; and the brown eyes had such a pathetic droop in them that it went to the boys very heart Was Polly homesick? and so soon! POLLY IS COMFORTED Yes it must be confessed Polly was homesick All her imaginations of her mothers hard work increased by her absence loomed up before her till she was almost ready to fly home without a minutes warning At night when no one knew it the tears would come racing over the poor forlorn little face and would not be squeezed back It got to be noticed finally; and one and all redoubled their exertions to make everything twice as pleasant as ever! The only place except in front of the grand piano where Polly approached a state of comparative happiness was in the greenhouse Here she would stay comforted and soothed among the lovely plants and rich exotics rejoicing the heart of Old Turner the gardener who since Pollys first rapturous entrance had taken her into his good graces for all time Every chance she could steal after practice hours were over and after the clamorous demands of the boys upon her time were fully satisfied was seized to fly on the wings of the wind to the flowers But even with the music and flowers the dancing light in the eyes went down a little; and Polly growing more silent and pale moved around with a little droop to the small figure that had only been wont to fly through the wide halls and spacious rooms with gay and springing step x93Polly dont like usx94 at last said Van one day in despair x93Then dearx94 said Mrs Whitney x93you must be kinder to her than ever; think what it would be for one of you to be away from home even among friendsx94 x93Id like it first rate to be away from Percyx94 said Van reflectively; x93I wouldnt come back in three no six weeksx94 x93My sonx94 said his mamma x93just stop and think how badly you would feel if you really couldnt see Percyx94 x93Wellx94 said Van and he showed signs of relenting a little at that; x93but Percy is perfectly awful mamma you dont know; and he feels so smart toox94 he said vindictively x93Wellx94 said Mrs Whitney softly x93lets think what we can do for Polly; it makes me feel very badly to see her sad little facex94 x93I dont knowx94 said Van running over in his mind all the possible ways he could think of for entertaining anybody x93unless shed like my new book of travels--or my velocipedex94 he added x93Im afraid those wouldnt quite answer the purposex94 said his mamma smiling--x93especially the last; yet we must think of somethingx94 But just here Mr King thought it about time to take matters into his hands So with a great many chucklings and shruggings when no one was by he had departed after breakfast one day simply saying he shouldnt be back to lunch Polly sat in the drawing-room near the edge of the twilight practicing away bravely Somehow of all the days when the home feeling was the strongest this day it seemed as if she could bear it no longer If she could only see Phronsie for just one moment! x93I shall have to give up!x94 she moaned x93I cant bear it!x94 and over went her head on the music rack x93Where is she?x94 said a voice over in front of the piano in the gathering dusk--unmistakably Mr Kings x93Oh shes always at the pianox94 said Van x93She must be there now somewherex94 and then somebody laughed Then came in the loudest of whispers from little Dick x93Oh Jappy whatll she say?x94 x93Hush!x94 said one of the other boys; x93do be still Dick!x94 Polly sat up very straight and whisked off the tears quickly Up came Mr King with an enormous bundle in his arms; and he marched up to the piano puffing with his exertions x93Here Polly hold your armsx94 he had only strength to gasp And then he broke out into a loud burst of merriment in which all the troop joined until the big room echoed with the sound At this the bundle opened suddenly and--out popped Phronsie! x93Here Im! Im here Polly!x94 But Polly couldnt speak; and if Jasper hadnt caught her just in time she would have tumbled over backward from the stool Phronsie and all! x93Arent you glad Ive come Polly?x94 asked Phronsie with her little face close to Pollys own That brought Polly to x93Oh Phronsie!x94 she cried and strained her to her heart; while the boys crowded around and plied her with sudden questions x93Now youll stayx94 cried Van; x93say Polly wont youx94 x93Werent you awfully surprised?x94 cried Percy; x93say Polly awfully?x94 x93Is her name Phronsiex94 put in Dick unwilling to be left out and not thinking of anything else to ask x93Boysx94 whispered their mother warningly x93she cant answer you; just look at her facex94 And to be sure our Pollys face was a study to behold All its old sunniness was as nothing to the joy that now transfigured it x93Oh!x94 she cried coming out of her rapture a little and springing over to Mr King with Phronsie still in her arms x93Oh you are the dearest and best Mr King I ever saw! but how did you make mammy let her come?x94 x93Isnt he splendid!x94 cried Jasper in intense pride swelling up x93Father knew how to do itx94 But Pollys arms were around the old gentlemans neck so she didnt hear x93There therex94 he said soothingly patting her brown fuzzy head Something was going down the old gentlemans neck that wet his collar and made him whisper very tenderly in her ear x93dont give way now Polly; Phronsiell see youx94 x93I knowx94 gasped Polly controlling her sobs; x93I wont--only--I cant thank you!x94 x93Phronsiex94 said Jasper quickly x93what do you suppose Prince said the other day?x94 x93What?x94 asked Phronsie in intense interest slipping down out of Pollys arms and crowding up close to Jaspers side x93What did he Jasper?x94 x93Oh-ho how funny!x94 laughed Van while little Dick burst right out x93Japser!x94 x93Be stillx94 said Jappy warningly while Phronsie stood surveying them all with grave eyes x93Well I asked him Dont you want to see Phronsie Pepper Prince? And do you know he just stood right upon his hind legs Phronsie and said Bark! yes Bark! Bark!x94 x93Did he really Jasper?x94 cried Phronsie delighted beyond measure; and clasping her hands in rapture x93all alone by himself?x94 x93Yes all alone by himselfx94 asserted Jasper vehemently and winking furiously to the others to stop their laughing; x93he did now truly Phronsiex94 x93Then mustnt I go and see him now Jasper? yes pretty soon now?x94 x93So you mustx94 cried Jasper enchanted at his success in amusing; x93and Ill go with youx94 x93Oh nox94 cried Phronsie shaking her yellow head x93Oh no Jasper; I must go by my very own selfx94 x93There Jap youve caught itx94 laughed Percy; while the others screamed at the sight of Jaspers face x93Oh Phronsie!x94 cried Polly turning around at the last words; x93how could you!x94 x93Dont mind it Pollyx94 whispered Jasper; x93twasnt her faultx94 x93Phronsiex94 said Mrs Whitney smilingly stooping over the child x93would you like to see a little pussy I have for you?x94 But the chubby face didnt look up brightly as usual and the next moment without a bit of warning Phronsie sprang past them all even Polly and flung herself into Mr Kings arms in a perfect torrent of sobs x93Oh! lets go back!x94 was all they heard! x93Dear me!x94 ejaculated the old gentleman in the utmost amazement; x93and such a time as Ive had to get her here too!x94 he added staring around on the astonished group none of whom had a word to say But Polly stood like a statue! All Jaspers frantic efforts at comfort utterly failed To think that Phronsie had left her for any one!--even good Mr King! The room seemed to buzz and everything to turn upside down--and just then she heard another cry--x93Oh I want Polly I do!x94 With a bound Polly was at Mr Kings side with her face on his coat close to the little tear-stained one The fat little arms unclasped their hold and transferred themselves willingly to Pollys neck; and Phronsie hugged up comfortingly to Pollys heart who poured into her ear all the loving words she had so longed to say Just then there was a great rush and a scuffling noise; and something rushed up to Phronsie x93Oh!x94 And then the next minute she had her arms around Princes neck too who was jumping all over her and trying as hard as he could to express his overwhelming delight x93Shes the cunningest little thing I ever sawx94 said Mrs Whitney enthusiastically afterward aside to Mr King x93Such lovely yellow hair and such exquisite brown eyes--the combination is very striking How did her mother ever let her go?x94 she asked impulsively x93I didnt believe you could persuade her fatherx94 x93I didnt have any fears if I worked it rightlyx94 said the old gentleman complacently x93I wasnt coming without her Marian if it could possibly be managed The truth is that Phronsie had been pining for Polly to such an extent that there was no other way but for her to have Polly; and her mother was just on the point although it almost killed her of sending for Polly--as if we should have let her go!x94 he cried in high dudgeon; just as if he owned the whole of the Peppers and could dispose of them all to suit his fancy! x93So you see I was just in time; in the very nick of time in fact!x94 x93So her mother was willing?x94 asked his daughter curiously x93Oh she couldnt help itx94 cried Mr King beginning to walk up and down the floor and beaming as he recalled his successful strategy; x93there wasnt the smallest use in thinking of anything else I told her twould just stop Polly from ever being a musician if she broke off now--and so twould you know yourself Marian for we should never get the child here again if we let her go now; and I talked--well I had to talk some; but well--the upshot is I did get her and I did bring her--and here she is!x94 And the old gentleman was so delighted with his success that he had to burst out into a series of short happy bits of laughter that occupied quite a space of time At last he came out of them and wiped his face vigorously x93And to think how fond the little girl is of you father!x94 said Mrs Whitney who hadnt yet gotten over her extreme surprise at the old gentlemans complete subjection to the little Peppers he whom all children had by instinct always approached so carefully and whom every one found it necessary to conciliate! x93Well shes a nice childx94 he said x93a very nice child; andx94 straightening himself up to his fullest height and looking so very handsome that his daughter could not conceal her admiration x93I shall always take care of Phronsie Pepper Marian!x94 x93So I hopex94 said Mrs Whitney; x93and father I do believe theyll repay you; for I do think theres good blood there; these children have a look about them that shows them worthy to be trustedx94 x93So they have so they havex94 assented Mr King and then the conversation dropped PHRONSIE Phronsie was toiling up and down the long oak staircase the next morning; slowly going from one step to the other drawing each little fat foot into place laboriously but with a pleased expression on her face that only gave some small idea of the rapture within Up and down she had been going for a long time perfectly fascinated; seeming to care for nothing else in the world but to work her way up to the top of the long flight only to turn and come down again She had been going on so for some time till at last Polly who was afraid she would tire herself all out sat down at the foot and begged and implored the little girl who had nearly reached the top to stop and rest x93Youll be tired to death Phronsie!x94 she said looking up at the small figure on its toilsome journey x93Why you must have gone up a million times! Do sit down pet; were all going out riding Phronsie this afternoon; and you cant go if youre all tired outx94 x93I wont be tired Pollyx94 said Phronsie turning around and looking at her x93do let me go just once more!x94 x93Wellx94 said Polly who never could refuse her anything x93just once Phronsie and then you must stopx94 So Phronsie kept on her way rejoicing while Polly still sat on the lowest stair and drummed impatiently on the stair above her waiting for her to get through Jappy came through the hall and found them thus x93Halloa Polly!x94 he said stopping suddenly; x93whats the matter?x94 x93Oh Phronsies been going sox94 said Polly looking up at the little figure above them which had nearly reached the top in delight x93that I cant stop her She has really Jappy almost all the morning; you cant think how crazy she is over itx94 x93Is that so?x94 said Jasper with a little laugh x93Hulloa Phronsie is it nice?x94 and he tossed a kiss to the little girl and then sat down by Polly x93Ohx94 said Phronsie turning to come down x93its the beyew-tiflest place I ever saw Jasper! the very be-yew-tiflest!x94 x93I wish she could have her picture paintedx94 whispered Jasper enthusiastically x93Look at her now Polly quick!x94 x93Yesx94 said Polly x93isnt she sweet!x94 x93Sweet!x94 said Jasper x93I should think she was!x94 The sunlight through an oriel window fell on the childish face and figure glinting the yellow hair and lighting up the radiant face that yet had a tender loving glance for the two who waited for her below One little foot was poised just in the act of stepping down to the next lower stair and the fat hand grasped the polished railing expressive of just enough caution to make it truly childish In after years Jasper never thought of Phronsie without bringing up this picture on that April morning when Polly and he sat at the foot of the stairs and looked up and saw it x93Wheres Jap?x94 called one of the boys; and then there was a clatter out into the hall x93What are you doing?x94 and Van came to a full stop of amazement and stared at them x93Restingx94 said Jappy concisely x93what do you want Van?x94 x93I want youx94 said Van x93we cant do anything without you Jappy; you know thatx94 x93Very wellx94 said Jasper getting up x93Come on Polly we must gox94 x93And Phronsiex94 said Van anxiously looking up to Phronsie who had nearly reached them by this time x93we want her toox94 x93Of coursex94 said Polly running up and meeting her to give her a hug; x93I dont go unless she doesx94 x93Where are we going Polly?x94 asked Phronsie looking back longingly to her beloved stairs as she was borne off x93To the greenhouse chick!x94 said Jasper x93to help Turner; and itll be good fun wont it Polly?x94 x93What is a greenhouse?x94 asked the child wonderingly x93All green Jasper?x94 x93Oh dear mex94 said Van doubling up x93do you suppose she thinks its painted green?x94 x93Its green inside Phronsie dearx94 said Jasper kindly x93and thats the best of allx94 When Phronsie was really let loose in the greenhouse she thought it decidedly best of all; and she went into nearly as much of a rapture as Polly did on her first visit to it In a few moments she was cooing and jumping among the plants while old Turner staid and particular as he was laughed to see her go x93Shes your sister Miss Mary aint she?x94 at last he asked as Phronsie bent lovingly over a little pot of heath and just touched one little leaf carefully with her finger x93Yesx94 said Polly x93but she dont look like mex94 x93She is like youx94 said Turner respectfully x93if she dont look like you; and the flowers know it toox94 he added x93and theyll love to see her coming just as they do youx94 For Polly had won the old gardeners heart completely by her passionate love for flowers and nearly every morning a little nosegay fresh and beautiful came up to the house for x93Miss Maryx94 And now nobody liked to think of the time or to look back to it when Phronsie hadnt been in the house When the little feet went pattering through halls and over stairs it seemed to bring sunshine and happiness into every ones heart just to hear the sounds Polly and the boys in the schoolroom would look up from their books and nod away brightly to each other and then fall to faster than ever on their lessons to get through the quicker to be with her again One thing Phronsie always insisted on and kept to it pertinaciously--and that was to go into the drawing-room with Polly when she went to practice and there with one of her numerous family of dolls to sit down quietly in some corner and wait till she got through Day after day she did it until Polly who was worried to think how tedious it must be for her would look around and say x93Oh childie do run out and playx94 x93I want to stayx94 Phronsie would beg in an injured tone; x93please let me Pollyx94 So Polly would jump and give her a kiss and then delighted to know that she was there would go at her practicing with twice the vigor and enthusiasm But Phronsies chief occupation at least when she wasnt with Polly was the entertainment and amusement of Mr King And never was she very long absent from his side which so pleased the old gentleman that he could scarcely contain himself as with a gravity befitting the importance of her office she would follow him around in a happy contented way that took with him immensely And now-a-days no one ever saw the old gentleman going out of a morning when Jasper was busy with his lessons without Phronsie by his side and many people turned to see the portly figure with the handsome head bent to catch the prattle of a little sunny-haired child who trotted along clasping his hand confidingly And nearly all of them stopped to gaze the second time before they could convince themselves that it was really that queer stiff old Mr King of whom they had heard so much And now the accumulation of dolls in the house became something alarming for Mr King observing Phronsies devotion to her family thought there couldnt possibly be too many of them; so he scarcely ever went out without bringing home one at least to add to them until Phronsie had such a remarkable collection as would have driven almost any other child nearly crazy with delight She however regarded them something in the light of a grave responsibility to be taken care of tenderly to be watched over carefully as to just the right kind of bringing up; and to have small morals and manners taught in just the right way Phronsie was playing in the corner of Mrs Whitneys little boudoir engaged in sending out invitations for an elaborate tea-party to be given by one of the dolls when Polly rushed in with consternation in her tones and dismay written all over her face x93What is it dear?x94 asked Mrs Whitney looking up from her embroidery x93Whyx94 said Polly x93how could I! I dont see--but Ive forgotten to write to mamsie to-day; its Wednesday you know and theres Monsieur comingx94 And poor Polly looked out in despair to see the lively little music teacher advancing towards the house at an alarming rate of speed x93That is because you were helping Van so long last evening over his lessonsx94 said Mrs Whitney; x93I am so sorryx94 x93Oh nox94 cried Polly honestly x93I had plenty of time--but I forgot twas mamsies day What will she do!x94 x93You will have to let it go now till the afternoon dear; theres no other way; it can go in the early morning mailx94 x93Oh dearx94 sighed Polly x93I suppose I mustx94 And she went down to meet Monsieur with a very distressed little heart Phronsie laid down the note of invitation she was scribbling and stopped to think; and a moment or two after at a summons from a caller Mrs Whitney left the room x93I know I ought tox94 said Phronsie to herself and the dolls x93yes I know I had; mamsie will feel oh! so bad when she dont get Pollys letter; and I know the way I do trulyx94 She got up and went to the window where she thought a minute; and then coming back she took up her little stubby pencil and bending over a small bit of paper she commenced to trace with laborious efforts and much hard breathing some very queer hieroglyphics that to her seemed to be admirable as at last she held them up with great satisfaction x93Good-byex94 she said then getting up and bowing to the dolls who sat among the interrupted invitations x93I wont be gone but a little bit of one minutex94 and she went out determinedly and shut the door Nobody saw the little figure going down the carriage drive so of course nobody could stop her When Phronsie got to the gateway she looked up and down the street carefully either way x93Yesx94 she said at last x93it was down here Im very sure I went with grandpax94 and immediately turned down the wrong way and went on and on grasping carefully her small and by this time rather soiled bit of paper At last she reached the business streets; and although she didnt come to the Post Office she comforted herself by the thought--x93it must be coming soon I guess its round this cornerx94 She kept turning corner after corner until at last a little anxious feeling began to tug at her heart; and she began to think--x93I wish I could see Polly--x94 And now she had all she could do to get out of the way of the crowds of people who were pouring up and down the thoroughfare Everybody jostled against her and gave her a push x93Oh dear!x94 thought Phronsie x93theres such a many big people!x94 and then there was no time for anything else but to stumble in and out to keep from being crushed completely beneath their feet At last an old huckster woman in passing along knocked off her bonnet with the end of her big basket which flew around and struck Phronsies head Not stopping to look into the piteous brown eyes she strode on without a word Phronsie turned in perfect despair to go down a street that looked as if there might be room enough for her in it Thoroughly frightened she plunged over the crossing to reach it! x93Look out!x94 cried a ringing voice x93Stop!x94 x93The little girlll be killed!x94 said others with bated breath as a powerful pair of horses whose driver could not pull them up in time dashed along just in front of her! With one cry Phronsie sprang between their feet and reached the opposite curbstone in safety! The plunge brought her up against a knot of gentlemen who were standing talking on the corner x93Whats this!x94 asked one whose back being next to the street hadnt seen the commotion as the small object dashed into their midst and fell up against him x93Didnt you see that narrow escape?x94 asked a second whose face had paled in witnessing it x93This little girl was nearly killed a moment ago--careless driving enough!x94 And he put out his hand to catch the child x93Bless me!x94 cried a third whirling around suddenly x93Bless me! you dont say so! why--x94 With a small cry but gladsome and distinct in its utterance Phronsie gave one look--x93Oh grandpa!x94 was all she could say x93Oh! where--x94 Mr King couldnt possibly have uttered another word for then his breath gave out entirely as he caught the small figure x93I went to the Post Officex94 said the child clinging to him in delight her tangled hair waving over the little white face into which a faint pink color was quickly coming back x93Only it wouldnt come; and I walked and walked--where is it grandpa?x94 And Phronsie gazed up anxiously into the old gentlemans face x93She went to the Post Office!x94 turning around on the others fiercely as if they had contradicted him--x93Why my child what were you going to do?x94 x93Mamsies letterx94 said Phronsie holding up for inspection the precious bit which by this time was decidedly forlorn x93Polly couldnt write; and Mamsied feel so bad not to get one--she would reallyx94 said the child shaking her head very soberly x93for Polly said sox94 x93And youve been--oh! I cant think of itx94 said Mr King tenderly taking her up on his shoulder x93well we must get home now or I dont know what Polly will do!x94 And without stopping to say a word to his friends he hailed a passing carriage and putting Phronsie in he commanded the driver to get them as quickly as possible to their destination In a few moments they were home Mr King pushed into the house with his burden x93Dont anybody knowx94 he burst out puffing up the stairs and scolding furiously at every step x93enough to take better care of this child than to have such goings on!x94 x93What is the matter father?x94 asked Mrs Whitney coming up the stairs after him x93What has happened out of the way?x94 x93Out of the way!x94 roared the old gentleman irascibly x93well if you want Phronsie racing off to the Post Office by herself and nearly getting killed poor child! yes Marian I say nearly killed!x94 he continued x93What do you mean?x94 gasped Mrs Whitney x93Why where have you been?x94 asked the old gentleman who wouldnt let Phronsie get down out of his arms under any circumstances; so there she lay poking up her head like a little bird and trying to say she wasnt in the least hurt x93wheres everybody been not to know shed gone?x94 he exclaimed x93wheres Polly--and Jasper--and all of em?x94 x93Pollys taking her music lessonx94 said Mrs Whitney x93Oh Phronsie darling!x94 and she bent over the child in her fathers arms and nearly smothered her with kisses x93Twas a naughty horsex94 said Phronsie sitting up straight and looking at her x93or I should have found the Post Office; and I lost off my bonnet toox94 she added for the first time realizing her loss putting her hand to her head; x93a bad old woman knocked it off with a basket--and now mamsie wont get her letter!x94 and she waved the bit which she still grasped firmly between her thumb and finger sadly towards Mrs Whitney x93Oh dearx94 groaned that lady x93how could we talk before her! But who would have thought it! Darlingx94 and she took the little girl from her fathers arms who at last let her go x93dont think of your mammas letter; well tell her how it wasx94 and she sat down in the first chair that she could reach; while Phronsie put her tumbled little head down on the kind shoulder and gave a weary little sigh x93It was so longx94 she said x93and my shoes hurtx94 and she thrust out the dusty little boots that spoke pathetically of the long and unaccustomed tramp x93Poor little lamb!x94 said Mr King getting down to unbutton them x93What a shame!x94 he mumbled pulling off half of the buttons in his frantic endeavors to get them off quickly But Phronsie never heard the last of his observations for in a minute she was fast asleep The tangled hair fell off from the tired little face; the breathing came peaceful and regular and with her little hand fast clasped in Mrs Whitneys she slept on and on Polly came flying up-stairs two or three at a time and humming a scrap of her last piece that she had just conquered x93Phronsiex94 she called with a merry little laugh x93where--x94 x93Hush!x94 said Mr King warningly and then just because he couldnt explain there without waking Phronsie up he took hold of Pollys two shoulders and marched her into the next room where he carefully closed the door and told her the whole thing using his own discretion about the very narrow escape she had passed through He told enough however for Polly to see what had been so near them; and she stood there so quietly alternately paling and flushing as he proceeded till at last when he finished Mr King was frightened almost to death at the sight of her face x93Oh goodness me Polly!x94 he said striding up to her and then fumbling around on the table to find a glass of water x93you are not going to faint are you? Phronsies all well now she isnt hurt in the least I assure you; I assure you--where is a glass of water! Marian ought to see that theres some here--that stupid Jane!x94 and in utter bewilderment he was fussing here and there knocking down so many things in general that the noise soon brought Polly to with a little gasp x93Oh dont mind me dear Mr King--Im--all wellx94 x93So you arex94 said the old gentleman setting up a toilet bottle that he had knocked over x93so you are; I didnt think youd go and tumble over Polly I really didntx94 and he beamed admiringly down on her And then Polly crept away to Mrs Whitneys side where she threw herself down on the floor to watch the little sleeping figure Her hand was gathered up into the kind one that held Phronsies; and there they watched and watched and waited x93Oh dearx94 said Phronsie suddenly turning over with a little sigh and bobbing up her head to look at Polly; x93Im so hungry! I havent had anything to eat in ever an ever so long Polly!x94 and she gazed at her with a very injured countenance x93So you must bex94 said Mrs Whitney kissing the flushed little face x93Polly must ring the bell for Jane to bring this little bird some crumbs x93Can I have a great many?x94 asked Phronsie lifting her eyes with the dewy look of sleep still lingering in them x93as many as two birdies?x94 x93Yes dearx94 said Mrs Whitney laughing; x93I think as many as three little birdies could eat Phronsiex94 x93Ohx94 said Phronsie and leaned back satisfied while Polly gave the order which was presently followed by Jane with a well-filled tray x93Nowx94 said Jappy when he heard the account of the adventure x93I say that letter ought to go to your mother Pollyx94 x93Ohx94 said Polly x93it would scare mamsie most to death Jappy!x94 x93Dont tell her the wholex94 said Jasper quickly x93I didnt mean that--about the horses and all that--but only enough to let her see how Phronsie tried to get it to herx94 x93And Im going to write to your brother Joelx94 said Van drawing up to the library table; x93Ill scare him Polly I guess; he wont tell your motherx94 x93Your crow-tracksll scare him enough without anything elsex94 said Percy pleasantly who really could write very nicely while Polly broke out in an agony x93Oh no Van you mustnt! you mustnt!x94 x93If Van doesx94 said Jasper decidedly x93itll be the last time hell write to the brown house I can tell him; and besides hell go to Coventryx94 This had the desired effect x93Lets all writex94 said Polly So a space on the table was cleared and the children gathered around it when there was great scratching of pens and clearing of ideas; which presently resulted in a respectable budget of letters into which Phronsies was lovingly tucked in the centre; and then they all filed out to put it into the letterbox in the hall for Thomas to mail with the rest in the morning GETTING READY FOR MAMSIE AND THE BOYS x93And Ill tell you Marian what I am going to dox94 Mr Kings voice was pitched on a higher key than usual; and extreme determination was expressed in every line of his face He had met Mrs Whitney at the foot of the staircase dressed for paying visits x93Oh are you going out?x94 he said glancing impatiently at her attire x93And Id just started to speak to you on a matter of great importance! Of the greatest importance indeed!x94 he repeated irritably as he stood with one gloved hand resting on the balustrade x93Oh its no matter fatherx94 she replied pleasantly; x93if its really important I can postpone going for another day and--x94 x93Really important!x94 repeated the old gentleman irascibly x93Havent I just told you its of the greatest importance? Theres no time to be lost; and with my state of health too its of the utmost consequence that I shouldnt be troubled Its very bad for me; I should think you would realize that Marianx94 x93Ill tell Thomas to take the carriage directly backx94 said Mrs Whitney stepping to the door x93Or stay father; Ill just run up and send the children out for a little drive The horses ought to be used too you knowx94 she said lightly preparing to run up to carry out the changed plan x93Never mind that nowx94 said Mr King abruptly x93I want you to give me your attention directlyx94 And walking towards the library door getting a fresh accession of impatience with every step he beckoned her to follow But his progress was somewhat impeded by little Dick--or rather little Dick and Prince who were standing at the top of the stairs to see Mrs Whitney off When he saw his mother retrace her steps supposing her yielding to the urgent entreaties that he was sending after her to stay at home the child suddenly changed his x93Good-byesx94 to vociferous howls of delight and speedily began to plunge down the stairs to welcome her But the staircase was long and little Dick was in a hurry and besides Prince was in the way The consequence was nobody knew just how that a bumping noise struck into the conversation that made the two below in the hall look up quickly to see the child and dog come rolling over the stairs at a rapid rate x93Zounds!x94 cried the old gentleman x93Here Thomas Thomas!x94 But as that individual was waiting patiently outside the door on the carriage box there was small hope of his being in time to catch the boy who was already in his mothers arms not quite clear by the suddenness of the whole thing as to how he came there x93Oh! oh! Dickys hurt!x94 cried somebody up above--followed by every one within hearing distance and all came rushing to the spot to ask a thousand questions all in the same minute There sat Mrs Whitney in one of the big carved chairs with little Dick in her lap and Prince walking gravely around and around him with the greatest expression of concern on his noble face Mr King was storming up and down and calling on everybody to bring a x93bowl of water and some brown paper; and be quick!x94 interpolated with showers of blame on Prince for sitting on the stairs and tripping people up! while Dick meanwhile was laughing and chatting and enjoying the distinction of making so many people run and of otherwise being the object of so much attention! x93I dont think he was sitting on the stairs fatherx94 said Jasper who when he saw that Dicky was really unhurt began to vindicate his dog x93He never does that; do you Sir?x94 he said patting the head that was lifted up to him as if to be defended x93And I expect we shall all be killed some day Jasperx94 said Mr King warming with his subject; and forgetting all about the brown paper and water which he had ordered and which was now waiting for him at his elbow x93just by that creaturex94 x93Hes the noblest--x94 began Jasper throwing his arms around his neck; an example which was immediately followed by the Whitney boys and the two little Peppers When Dick saw this he began to struggle to get down to add himself to the number x93Wheres the brown paper?x94 began Mr King seeing this and whirling around suddenly x93Hasnt any body brought it yet?x94 x93Here tis sirx94 said Jane handing him a generous supply x93Oh I dont want tox94 cried little Dick in dismay seeing his grandfather advance with an enormous piece of paper which previously wet in the bowl of water was now unpleasantly clammy and wet--x93oh no I dont want to be all stuck up with old horrid wet paper!x94 x93Hush dear!x94 said his mamma soothingly x93Grandpapa wants to put it on--there--x94 as Mr King dropped it scientifically on his head and then proceeded to paste another one over his left eye x93And I hope theyll all drop offx94 cried Dick savagely shaking his head to facilitate matters x93Yes I do every single one of em!x94 he added with an expression that seen under the brown bits was anything but benign x93Was Prince on the stairs Dick?x94 asked Jasper coming up and peering under his several adornments x93Tell us how you fell!x94 x93Nox94 said little Dick crossly and giving his head another shake x93He was up in the hall--oh dear I want to get downx94 and he began to stretch his legs and to struggle with so much energy that two or three pieces fell off and landed on the floor to his intense delight x93And how did you fall then?x94 said Jasper perseveringly x93Cant you remember Dicky boy?x94 x93I pushed Princeyx94 said Dick feeling with freedom from some of his encumbrances more disposed for conversation x93and made him go ahead--and then I fell on top of him--thats allx94 x93I guess Prince has saved him fatherx94 cried Jasper turning around with eyes full of pride and love on the dog who was trying as hard as he could to tell all the children how much he enjoyed their caresses And so it all came about that the consultation so summarily interrupted was never held For as Mrs Whitney was about retiring that evening Mr King rapped at her door on his way to bed x93Ohx94 he said popping in his head in response to her invitation to come in x93its nothing--only I thought Id just tell you a word or two about what Ive decided to dox94 x93Do you mean what you wanted to see me about this afternoon?x94 asked Mrs Whitney who hadnt thought of it since x93Do come in fatherx94 x93Its no consequencex94 said the old gentleman; x93no consequence at allx94 he repeated waving his hand emphatically x93because Ive made up my mind and arranged all my plans--its only about the Peppers--x94 x93The Peppers?x94 repeated Mrs Whitney x93Yes Well the fact of it is Im going to have them here for a visit--the whole of them you understand; thats all there is to it And I shall go down to see about all the arrangements--Jasper and I--day after to-morrowx94 said the old gentleman as if he owned the whole Pepper family inclusive and was the only responsible person to be consulted about their movements x93Will they come?x94 asked Mrs Whitney doubtfully x93Come? of coursex94 said Mr King sharply x93there isnt any other way; or else Mrs Pepper will be sending for her children--and of course you know Marian we couldnt allow that--well thats all; so good nightx94 and the door closed on his retreating footsteps And so Polly and Phronsie soon knew that mamsie and the boys were to be invited! And then the grand house big as it was didnt seem large enough to contain them x93I declarex94 said Jasper next day when they had been laughing and planning till they were all as merry as grigs x93if this old dungeon dont begin to seem a little like the little brown house Pollyx94 x93Twontx94 answered Polly hopping around on one toe followed by Phronsie x93till mamsie and the boys get here Jasper King!x94 x93Well theyll be here soonx94 said Jappy pleased at Pollys exultation over it x93for were going to-morrow to do the invitingx94 x93And Pollys to write a note to slip into Mariansx94 said Mr King putting his head in at the door x93And if you want your mother to come child why youd better mention it as strong as you canx94 x93Im going to writex94 said Phronsie pulling up after a prolonged skip all out of breath x93Im going to write and beg mamsie dear Then shell come I guessx94 x93I guess she willx94 said Mr King looking at her x93You go on Phronsie and write; and that letter shall go straight in my coat pocket alone by itselfx94 x93Shall it?x94 asked Phronsie coming up to him x93and nobody will take it out till you give it to mamsie?x94 x93No nobody shall touch itx94 said the old gentleman stooping to kiss the upturned face x93till I put it into her own handx94 x93Thenx94 said Phronsie in the greatest satisfaction x93Im going to write this very one minute!x94 and she marched away to carry her resolve into immediate execution Before they got through they had quite a bundle of invitations and pleadings; for each of the three boys insisted on doing his part so that when they were finally done up in an enormous envelope and put into Mr Kings hands he told them with a laugh that there was no use for Jappy and himself to go as those were strong enough to win almost anybodys consent However the next morning they set off happy in their hopes and bearing the countless messages which the children would come up every now and then to intrust to them declaring that they had forgotten to put them in the letters x93Youd had to have had an express wagon to carry the letters if you had put them all inx94 at last cried Jasper x93Youve given us a bushel of things to rememberx94 x93And oh! dont forget to ask Ben to bring Cherryx94 cried Polly the last minute as they were driving off although she had put it in her letter at least a dozen times; x93and oh dear! of course the flowers cant comex94 x93Weve got plenty herex94 said Jasper x93You would not know what to do with them Pollyx94 x93Well I do wish mamsie would give some to kind Mrs Henderson thenx94 said Polly on the steps clasping her hands anxiously while Jasper told Thomas to wait till he heard the rest of the message x93and to grandma--you know Grandma Bascom; she was so good to usx94 she said impulsively x93And oh! dont let her forget to carry some to dear dear Dr Fisher; and dont forget to give him our love Jappy; dont forget that!x94 and Polly ran down the steps to the carriage door where she gazed up imploringly to the boys face x93I guess I wontx94 cried Jasper x93when I think how he saved your eyes Polly! Hes the best fellow I know!x94 he finished in an impulsive burst x93And dont let mamsie forget to carry some in to good old Mr and Mrs Beebe in town--where Phronsie got her shoes you know; that is if mamsie canx94 she added remembering how very busy her mother would be x93Ill carry them myselfx94 said Jasper; x93were going to stay over till the next day you knowx94 x93O!x94 cried Polly radiant as a rose x93will you really Jappy? youre so good!x94 x93Yes I willx94 said Jasper x93everything you want done Polly; anything else?x94 he asked quickly as Mr King impatient to be off showed unmistakable symptoms of hurrying up Thomas x93Oh nox94 said Polly x93only do look at the little brown house Jasper as much as you canx94 and Polly left the rest unfinished Jasper seemed to understand however for he smiled brightly as he said looking into the brown eyes x93Ill do it all Polly; every single thingx94 And then they were off Mamsie and the boys! could Polly ever wait till the next afternoon that would bring the decision? Long before it was possibly time for the carriage to come back from the depot Polly with Phronsie and the three boys who improving Jaspers absence had waited upon her with the grace and persistence of cavaliers of the olden time were drawn up at the old stone gateway x93Oh dearx94 said Van with an impatient fling; x93they never will come!x94 x93Wont they Polly?x94 asked Phronsie anxiously and standing quite still x93Dear me yesx94 said Polly with a little laugh x93Van only means theyll be a good while Phronsie Theyre sure to come some timex94 x93Oh!x94 said Phronsie quite relieved; and she commenced her capering again in extreme enjoyment x93Im goingx94 said little Dick x93to run down and meet themx94 Accordingly off he went and was immediately followed by Percy who started with the laudable desire of bringing him back; but finding it so very enjoyable he stayed himself and frolicked with Dick till the others hearing the fun all took hold of hands and flew off to join them x93Nowx94 said Polly when they recovered their breath a little x93lets all turn our backs to the road; and the minute we hear the carriage we must whirl round; and the one who sees em first can ask first Is mamsie coming?x94 x93All rightx94 cried the boys x93Turn round Dickx94 said Percy with a little shove for Dick was staring with all his might right down the road And so they all flew around till they looked like five statues set up to grace the sidewalk x93Suppose a big dog should comex94 suggested Van pleasantly x93and snap at our backs!x94 At this little Dick gave a small howl and turned around in a fright x93There isnt any dog comingx94 said Polly x93What does make you say such awful things Van?x94 x93I hear a noisex94 said Phronsie; and so they all whirled around in expectation But it proved to be only a market wagon coming at a furious pace down the road with somebodys belated dinner So they all had to whirl back again as before The consequence was that when the carriage did come nobody heard it Jasper looking out was considerably astonished to see drawn up in solemn array with their backs to the road five children who stood as if completely petrified x93What in the world!x94 he began and called to Thomas to stop whose energetic x93Whoa!x94 reaching the ears of the frozen line caused it to break ranks and spring into life at an alarming rate x93Oh is she coming Jappy? Is she? Is she?x94 they all screamed together swarming up to the carriage door and over the wheels x93Yesx94 said Jasper looking at Polly At that Phronsie made a little cheese and sat right down on the pavement in an ecstasy x93Get in here all of you;x94 said Jasper merrily; x93help Polly in first For shame Dick! dont scramble sox94 x93Dick always shovesx94 said Percy escorting Polly up with quite an air x93I dont eitherx94 said Dick; x93you pushed me awful just a little while agox94 he added indignantly x93Do say awfullyx94 corrected Van crowding up to get in x93You leave off your lys sox94 he finished critically x93I dont know anything about any leesx94 said little Dick who usually so good natured was now thoroughly out of temper; x93I want to get in and go homex94 and he showed evident symptoms of breaking into a perfect roar x93Therex94 said Polly lilting him up x93there he goes! now--one two three!x94 and little Dick was spun in so merrily that the tears changed into a happy laugh x93Now then bundle in all the rest of youx94 put in Mr King who seemed to be in the best of spirits x93Thats it; go on Thomas!x94 x93When are they coming?x94 Polly found time to ask in the general jumble x93In three weeks from to-morrowx94 said Jasper x93And everythings all right Polly! and the whole of them Cherry and all will be here then!x94 x93Oh!x94 said Polly x93Here we are!x94 cried Van jumping out almost before the carriage door was open x93Mamma; mammax94 he shouted to Mrs Whitney in the doorway x93the Peppers are coming and the little brown house too!--everything and everybody!x94 x93They are!x94 said Percy as wild as his brother; x93and everythings just splendid! Jappy said sox94 x93Everythings comingx94 said little Dick tumbling up the steps--x93and the bird--and--and--x94 x93And mamsie!x94 finished Phronsie impatient to add her part--while Polly didnt say anything--only looked Three weeks! x93I cant wait!x94 thought Polly at first in counting over the many hours before the happy day would come But on Jaspers suggesting that they should all do something to get ready for the visitors and have a general trimming up with vines and flowers beside--the time passed away much more rapidly than was feared Polly chose a new and more difficult piece of music to learn to surprise mamsie Phronsie had aspired to an elaborate pin-cushion that was nearly done made of bits of worsted and canvas over whose surface she had wandered according to her own sweet will in a way charming to behold x93I dont know what to dox94 said Van in despair x93cause I dont know what shed likex94 x93Cant you draw her a little picture?x94 asked Polly x93Shed like thatx94 x93Does she like pictures?x94 asked Van with the greatest interest x93Yes indeed!x94 said Polly x93I guess youd think so if you could see her!x94 x93I know what I shall dox94 with a dignified air said Percy who couldnt draw and therefore looked down on all Vans attempts with the greatest scorn x93And it wont be any old pictures eitherx94 he added x93What is it old fellow?x94 asked Jasper x93tell on now your grand planx94 x93No Im not going to tellx94 said Percy with the greatest secrecy x93until the very dayx94 x93What will you do sir?x94 asked Jasper pulling one of Dicks ears who stood waiting to speak as if his mind was made up and wouldnt be changed for anyone! x93I shall give Ben one of my kitties--the littlest and the best!x94 he said with heroic self-sacrifice A perfect shout greeted this announcement x93Fancy Ben going round with one of those awful little thingsx94 whispered Jappy to Polly who shook at the very thought x93Dont laugh! oh its dreadful to laugh at him Jappyx94 she said when she could get voice enough x93No I shant tellx94 said Percy when the fun had subsided; who finding that no one teased him to divulge his wonderful plan kept trying to harrow up their feelings by parading it x93You neednt thenx94 screamed Van who was nearly dying to know x93I dont believe its so very dreadful much anywayx94 x93Whats yours Jappy?x94 asked Polly x93I know yours will be just splendidx94 x93Oh no it isntx94 said Jasper smiling brightly x93but as I didnt know what better I could do Im going to get a little stand and then beg some flowers of Turner to fill it and--x94 x93Why thats mine!x94 screamed Percy in the greatest disappointment x93Thats just what I was going to do!x94 x93Hoh hoh!x94 shouted Van; x93I thought you wouldnt tell Mr Percy! hoh hoh!x94 x93Hoh hoh!x94 echoed Dick x93Hushx94 said Jappy x93Why Percy I didnt know as you had thought of thatx94 he said kindly x93Well then you do it and Ill take something else I dont care as long as Mrs Pepper gets emx94 x93I didnt exactly mean thatx94 began Percy; x93mine was roots and little flowers growingx94 x93He means what he gets in the woodsx94 said Polly explaining; x93dont you Percy?x94 x93Yesx94 said the boy x93And then I was going to put stones and things in among them to make them look prettyx94 x93And they willx94 cried Jasper x93Go ahead Percy theyll look real pretty and then Turner will give you some flowers for the stand I know; Ill ask him to-morrowx94 x93Will you?x94 cried Percy x93thatll be fine!x94 x93Mine is the bestx94 said Van just at this juncture; but it was said a little anxiously as he saw how things were prospering with Percy; x93for my flowers in the picture will always be there and your old roots and things will diex94 x93What will yours be then Jappy?x94 asked Polly very soberly x93The stand of flowers would have been just lovely! and you do fix them so nicex94 she added sorrowfully x93Oh Ill find something elsex94 said Jappy cheerfully who had quite set his heart on giving the flowers x93Let me see--I might carve her a bracketx94 x93Dox94 cried Polly clapping her hands enthusiastically x93And do carve a little bird like the one you did on your fathersx94 x93I willx94 said Jasper x93just exactly like it Now weve got something to do before we welcome the little brown house people--so lets fly at it and the time wont seem so longx94 And at last the day came when they could all say--To-morrow theyll be here! Well the vines were all up; and pots of lovely climbing ferns and all manner of pretty green things had been arranged and re-arranged a dozen times till everything was pronounced perfect; and a big green x93Welcomex94 over the library door made of laurel leaves by the patient fingers of all the children stared down into their admiring eyes as much as to say x93Ill do my part!x94 x93Oh dearx94 said Phronsie when evening came and the children were as usual assembled on the rug before the fire their tongues running wild with anticipation and excitement x93I dont mean to go to bed at all Polly; I dont trulyx94 x93Oh yes you dox94 said Polly laughing; x93then youll be all fresh and rested to see mammy when she does comex94 x93Oh nox94 said Phronsie shaking her head soberly and speaking in an injured tone x93Im not one bit tired Polly; not one bitx94 x93You neednt go yet Phronsiex94 said Polly x93You can sit up half an hour yet if you want tox94 x93But I dont want to go to bed at allx94 said the child anxiously x93for then I may be asleep when mamsie comes Pollyx94 x93Shes afraid she wont wake upx94 said Percy laughing x93Oh therell be oceans of time before they come Phronsiex94 x93What is oceansx94 asked Phronsie coming up and looking at him doubtfully x93He means mamsie wont get here till afternoonx94 said Polly catching her up and kissing her; x93then I guess youll be awake Phronsie petx94 So Phronsie allowed herself to be persuaded at the proper time to be carried off and inducted into her little nightgown And when Polly went up to bed she found the little pin-cushion with its hieroglyphics that she had insisted on taking to bed with her still tightly grasped in the little fat hand x93Shell roll over and muss itx94 thought Polly; x93and then shell feel bad in the morning I guess Id better lay it on the bureaux94 So she drew it carefully away without awaking the little sleeper and placed it where she knew Phronsies eyes would rest on it the first thing in the morning It was going on towards the middle of the night when Phronsie whose exciting dreams of mamsie and the boys wouldnt let her rest quietly woke up; and in the very first flash she thought of her cushion x93Why where--x94 she said in the softest little tones only half awake x93why Polly where is it?x94 and she began to feel all around her pillow to see if it had fallen down there But Pollys brown head with its crowd of anticipations and busy plans was away off in dreamland and she breathed on and on perfectly motionless x93I guess I betterx94 said Phronsie to herself now thoroughly awake and sitting up in bed x93not wake her up Poor Pollys tired; I can find it myself I know I canx94 So she slipped out of bed and prowling around on the floor felt all about for the little cushion x93Tisnt here oh no it isntx94 she sighed at last and getting up she stood still a moment lost in thought x93Maybe Janes put it out in the hallx94 she said as a bright thought struck her x93I can get it therex94 and out she pattered over the soft carpet to the table at the end of the long hall where Jane often placed the childrens playthings over night As she was coming back after her fruitless search she stopped to peep over the balustrade down the fascinating flight of stairs now so long and dark Just then a little faint ray of light shot up from below and met her eyes x93Why!x94 she said in gentle surprise x93theyre all down-stairs! I guess theyre making something for mamsie--Im going to seex94 So carefully picking her way over the stairs with her little bare feet and holding on to the balustrade at every step she went slowly down guided by the light which as she neared the bottom of the flight she saw came from the library door x93Oh isnt it funny!x94 and she gave a little happy laugh x93They wont know Im comin!x94 and now the soft little feet went pattering over the thick carpet until she stood just within the door There she stopped perfectly still Two dark figures big and powerful were bending over something that Phronsie couldnt see between the two big windows A lantern on the floor flung its rays over them as they were busily occupied; and the firelight from the dying coals made the whole stand out distinctly to the gaze of the motionless little figure x93Why! what are you doing with my grandpas things?x94 The soft clear notes fell like a thunderbolt upon the men With a start they brought themselves up and stared--only to see a little white-robed figure with its astonished eyes uplifted with childlike earnest gaze as she waited for her answer For an instant they were powerless to move; and stood as if frozen to the spot till Phronsie moving one step forward piped forth x93Naughty men to touch my dear grandpas things!x94 With a smothered cry one of them started forward with arm uplifted; but the other sprang like a cat and intercepted the blow x93Stop!x94 was all he said A noise above the stairs--a rushing sound through the hall! Something will save Phronsie for the household is aroused! The two men sprang through the window having no time to catch the lantern or their tools as Polly followed by one and another rushed in and surrounded the child x93What!x94 gasped Polly and got no further x93STOP THIEF!x94 roared Mr King hurrying over the stairs The children frightened at the strange noises began to cry and scream as they came running through the halls to the spot Jasper rushed for the men-servants And there stood Phronsie surrounded by the pale group x93Twas two naughty menx94 she said lifting her little face with the grieved astonished look still in the big brown eyes x93and they were touching my grandpas things Polly!x94 x93I should think they werex94 said Jasper running over amongst the few scattered tools and the lantern to the windows where on the floor was a large table cover hastily caught up by the corners into which a vast variety of silver jewelry and quantities of costly articles were gathered ready for flight x93Theyve broken open your safe father!x94 he cried in excitement x93see!x94 x93And they put up their hand--one man didx94 went on Phronsie x93And the other said Stop!--oh Polly you hurt me!x94 she cried as Polly unable to bear the strain any longer held her so tightly she could hardly breathe x93Go onx94 said Jasper x93how did they look?x94 x93All blackx94 said the child pushing back her wavy hair and looking at him x93very all black Jasperx94 x93And their faces Phronsie?x94 said Mr King getting down on his old knees on the floor beside her x93Bless me! somebody else ask her I cant talk!x94 x93How did their faces look Phronsie dear?x94 asked Jasper taking one of the cold hands in his x93Cant you think?x94 x93Oh!x94 said Phronsie--and then she gave a funny little laugh x93two big holes Jasper thats all they had!x94 x93She means they were maskedx94 whispered Jasper x93What did you get up for?x94 Mrs Whitney asked x93Dear child what made you get out of bed?x94 x93Why my cushion-pinx94 said Phronsie looking worried at once x93I couldnt find it and--x94 But just at this without a bit of warning Polly tumbled over in a dead faint And then it was all confusion again And so on the following afternoon it turned out that the Peppers about whose coming there had been so many plans and expectations just walked in as if they had always lived there The greater excitement completely swallowed up the less! WHICH TREATS OF A GOOD MANY MATTERS x93Phooh!x94 said Joel a few mornings after the emptying of the little brown house into the big one when he and Van were rehearsing for the fiftieth time all the points of the eventful night x93phooh! if Id been here they wouldnt have got away I guess!x94 x93What would you have done?x94 asked Van bristling up at this reflection on their courage and squaring up to him x93What would you have done Joel Pepper?x94 x93Id a-pitched right into em--like--everything!x94 said Joel valiantly; x93and a-caught em! Yes every single one of the Bunglers!x94 x93The what?x94 said Van bursting into a loud laugh x93The Bunglersx94 said Joel with a red face x93Thats what you said they were anywayx94 he added positively x93I said Burglarsx94 said Van doubling up with amusement while Joel stood a little sturdy figure regarding him with anything but a sweet countenance x93Well anyway Id a-caught em so there!x94 he said as Van at last showed signs of coming out of his fit of laughter and got up and wiped his eyes x93Howd you have caught em?x94 asked Van scornfully surveying the square little country figure before him x93You cant hit any x93Cant?x94 said Joel the black eyes flashing volumes and coming up in front of Van x93You better believe I can Van Whitney!x94 x93Come out in the back yard and try thenx94 said Van hospitably perfectly delighted at the prospect and flying alone towards the door x93Come right out and tryx94 x93All right!x94 said Joel following sturdily equally delighted to show his skill x93Therex94 said Van taking off his jacket and flinging it on the grass while Joel immediately followed suit with his little homespun one x93Now we can begin perfectly splendid! I wont hit hardx94 he added patronizingly as both boys stood ready x93Hit as hard as youve a-mind tox94 said Joel x93Im a-going tox94 x93Oh you mayx94 said Van politely x93because youre company All right--now!x94 So at it they went Before very many minutes were over Van relinquished all ideas of treating his company with extra consideration and was only thinking how he could possibly hold his own with the valiant little country lad Oh if he could only be called to his lessons--anything that would summon him into the house! Just then a window above their heads was suddenly thrown up and his mammas voice in natural surprise and distress called quickly x93Children what are you doing? Oh Van how could you!x94 Both contestants turned around suddenly Joel looked up steadily x93Were a-hitting maam; he said I couldnt and so we came out and--x94 x93Oh Vannyx94 said Mrs Whitney reproachfully x93to treat a little guest in this way!x94 x93I wanted tox94 said Joel cheerfully; x93twas great fun Lets begin again Van!x94 x93We mustntx94 said Van readily giving up the charming prospect and beginning to edge quickly towards the house x93Mamma wouldnt like it you know He hits splendidly mammax94 he added generously looking up x93He does reallyx94 x93And so does Vanx94 cried Joel his face glowing at the praise x93Well come out every dayx94 he added slipping into his jacket and turning enthusiastically back to Van x93And perhaps he could have pitched into the Burglarsx94 finished Van ignoring the invitation and tumbling into his jacket with alarming speed x93I know I could!x94 cried Joel scampering after him into the house x93If Id only a-been here!x94 x93Wheres Ben?x94 said Van bounding into the hall and flinging himself down on one of the chairs x93Oh dear Im so hot! Say Joe where do you spose Ben is?x94 x93I dont knowx94 replied Joel who didnt even puff x93I saw him a little while ago with master Percyx94 said Jane who was going through the hall x93There now! and theyve gone off somewherex94 cried Van in extreme irritation and starting up quickly x93I know they have Which way did they go Jane? And how long ago?x94 x93Oh I dont knowx94 replied Jane carelessly x93half an hour maybe; and they didnt go nowhere as I see at least they were talking at the door and I was going up-stairsx94 x93Right here?x94 cried Van and stamping with his foot to point out the exact place; x93at this door Jane?x94 x93Yes yesx94 said Jane; x93at that very doorx94 and then she went into the dining-room to her work x93Oh dear me!x94 cried Van and flying out on the veranda he began to peer wildly up and down the drive x93And theyve gone to some splendid place I know and wouldnt tell us Thats just like Percy!x94 he added vindictively x93hes always stealing away! dont you see em Joel? oh do come out and look!x94 x93Tisnt any usex94 said Joel coolly sitting down on the chair Van had just vacated and swinging his feet comfortably; x93theyre miles away if theyve been gone half an hour Im goin up-stairsx94 and he sprang up and energetically pranced to the stairs x93They arent up-stairs!x94 screamed Van in scorn bounding into the hall x93Dont go; I know that theyve gone down to the museum!x94 x93The what?x94 exclaimed Joel nearly at the top peering over the railing x93Whats that you said--what is it?x94 x93A museumx94 shouted Van x93and its a perfectly elegant place Joel Pepper and Percy knows I like to go; and now hes taken Ben off; and hell show him all the things! and theyll all be old when I take him--and--and--oh! I hope the snakes will bite him!x94 he added trying to think of something bad enough x93Do they have snakes there?x94 asked Joel staring x93Yes they dox94 snapped out Van x93They have everything!x94 x93Well they shant bite Ben!x94 cried Joel in terror x93Oh! do you suppose they will?x94 and he turned right straight around on the stairs and looked at Van x93Nox94 said Van x93they wont bite--whats the matter Joe?x94 x93Oh they mayx94 said Joel his face working and screwing both fists into his eyes; at last he burst right out into a torrent of sobs x93Oh dont let em Van--dont!x94 x93Why they cantx94 said Van in an emphatic voice running up the stairs to Joels side frightened to death at his tears Then he began to shake his jacket sleeve violently to bring him back to reason x93Wait Joe! oh do stop! oh dear what shall I do! I tell you they cant bitex94 he screamed as loud as he could into his ear x93You said--you--hoped--they--wouldx94 said Joels voice in smothered tones x93Well they wont anywayx94 said Van decidedly x93Cause theyre all stuffed--so there now!x94 x93Aint they alive--nor anythin?x94 asked Joel bringing one black eye into sight from behind his chubby hands x93Nox94 said Van x93theyre just as dead as anything Joel Pepper--been dead years! and theres old crabs there too old dead crabs--and theyre just lovely! Oh such a lots of eggs as theyve got! And there are shells and bugs and stones--and an awful old crocodile and--x94 x93Oh dear!x94 sighed Joel perfectly overcome at such a vision and sitting down on the stairs to think x93Well mamsiell know where Ben isx94 he said springing up x93And then I tell you Van well just tag em!x94 x93So she willx94 cried Van x93Why didnt we think of that before? I wanted to thinkx94 x93I didx94 said Joel x93That was where I was goinx94 Without any more ado they rushed into Mrs Peppers big sunny room there to see seated at the square table between the two large windows the two lost ones bending over what seemed to be an object of the greatest importance for Polly was hanging over Bens shoulder with intense pride and delight which she couldnt possibly conceal and Davie was crowded as near as he could get to Percys elbow Phronsie and little Dick were perched comfortably on the corner of the table surveying the whole scene in quiet rapture; and Mrs Pepper with her big mending basket was ensconced over by the deep window seat just on the other side of the room underneath Cherrys cage and looking up between quick energetic stitches over at the busy group with the most placid expression on her face x93Oh!--what you doin?x94 cried Joel flying up to them x93Let us see do Ben!x94 x93What is it?x94 exclaimed Van squeezing in between Percy and Ben x93Dont--x94 began Percy x93There see youve knocked his elbow and spoilt it!x94 x93Oh no he hasntx94 said Ben putting down his pencil and taking up a piece of rubber x93There see it all comes out--as good as everx94 x93Isnt it just elegant?x94 said Percy in the most pleased tone and wriggling his toes under the table to express his satisfaction x93Yesx94 said Van craning his neck to get a better view of the picture now nearly completed x93Its perfectly splendid Howd you do it Ben?x94 x93I dont knowx94 replied Ben with a smile carefully shading in a few last touches x93It just drew itselfx94 x93Tisnt anything to what he can dox94 said Polly standing up as tall as she could and beaming at Ben x93He used to draw most beautiful at homex94 x93Better than this?x94 asked Van with great respect and taking up the picture after some demur on Percys part and examining it critically x93I dont believe it Pollyx94 x93Phooh; he did!x94 exclaimed Joel looking over his shoulder at a wonderful view of a dog in an extremely excited state of mind running down an interminable hill to bark at a locomotive and train of cars whizzing along a curve in the foreground x93Lots bettern that! Ben can do anything!x94 he added in an utterly convincing way x93Now give it backx94 cried Percy holding out his hand in alarm x93Im going to ask mamma to have it framed; and then Im going to hang it right over my bedx94 he finished as Van reluctantly gave up the treasure x93Did you draw all the time in the little brown house?x94 asked Van lost in thought x93How I wish Id been there!x94 x93Dear no!x94 cried Polly with a little skip turning away to laugh x93He didnt have hardly any time and--x94 x93Why not?x94 asked Percy x93Cause there was things to dox94 said Polly x93But sometimes when it rained and he couldnt go out and work and there wasnt anything to do in the house--then wed have--oh!x94 and she drew a long breath at the memory x93such a time you cant think!x94 x93Didnt you wish it would always rain?x94 asked Van still gazing at the picture x93Dear no!x94 began Polly x93I didntx94 broke in Joel in horror x93I wouldnt a-had it rain for anything!--only once in a whilex94 he added as he thought of the good times that Polly had spoken of x93Twas nice outdoorsx94 said little Davie reflectively; x93and nice inside toox94 And then he glanced over to his mother who gave him a smile in return x93And twas nice alwaysx94 x93Wellx94 said Van returning to the picture x93I do wish youd tell me how to draw Ben I cant do anything but flowersx94 he said in a discouraged way x93Flowers arent anythingx94 said Percy pleasantly x93Thats girls work; but dogs and horses and cars--those are just good!x94 x93Will you Ben?x94 asked Van looking down into the big blue eyes so kindly turned up to his x93Yes indeed I willx94 cried Ben x93that is all I know; tisnt much but everything I can Ill tell youx94 x93Then I can learn cant I?x94 cried Van joyfully x93Oh tell me too Benx94 cried Percy x93will you?

Wait just a minute dox94 And he ran back for a cricket which he placed at Mrs Peppers feet; and then sitting down on it he leaned on her comfortable lap in order to hear better x93Wait for me too till I get a chairx94 called Percy starting x93Dont begin till I get therex94 x93Here let me Percyx94 said Ben; and he drew forward a big easy-chair that the boy was tugging at with all his might x93Now Im ready toox94 said Polly setting small finishing stitches quickly with a merry little flourish and drawing her chair nearer her mothers as she spoke x93Now begin pleasex94 said Van x93all the nice times you knowx94 x93She couldnt tell all the nice times if she had ten years to tell them in could she Polly?x94 said Jasper x93Well in the first place thenx94 said Mrs Pepper clearing her throat x93the little brown house had got to be you know so we made up our minds to make it just the nicest brown house that ever was!x94 x93And it was!x94 declared Jasper with an emphatic ring to his voice x93The very nicest place in the whole world!x94 x93Oh dearx94 broke in Van enviously; x93Jappys always said so I wish wed been there too!x94 x93We didnt want anybody but Jappyx94 said Joel not very politely x93Oh Joey for shame!x94 cried Polly x93Jappy used to bakex94 cried little Davie; x93an we all made pies; an then we sat round an ate em an then told storiesx94 x93Oh what fun!x94 cried Percy x93Do tell us!x94 So the five little Peppers and Jasper flew off into reminiscences and accounts of the funny doings and Mrs Pepper joined in heartily till the room got very merry with the glee and enthusiasm called forth; so much so that nobody heard Mrs Whitney knock gently at the door and nobody answering she was obliged to come in by herself x93Well wellx94 she cried merrily looking at the swarm of little ones around Mrs Pepper and the big chair x93You are having a nice time! May I come and listen?x94 x93Oh if you will sisterx94 cried Jasper springing off from his arm of the chair while Ben flew from the other side to hurry and get her a chair Percy and Van rushed too knocking over so many things that they didnt help much; and little Dick poked his head out from Mrs Peppers arms when he saw his mamma sitting down to stay and began to scramble down to get into her lap x93There nowx94 said Mrs Whitney smiling over at Mrs Pepper who was smiling at her x93You have your baby and I have mine! Now children whats it all about? What has Mrs Pepper been telling you?x94 x93Oh the little brown housex94 cried Dicky his cheeks all a-flame x93The dearest little house mamma! I wish I could live in one! x93Twouldnt be the same without the Peppers in itx94 said Jasper x93Not a bit of it!x94 x93And they had such perfectly elegant timesx94 cried Percy enviously drawing up to her side x93Oh you cant think mamma!x94 x93Well nowx94 said his mamma x93do go on and let me hear some of the nice timesx94 So away they launched again and Mrs Whitney was soon enjoying it as hugely as the children when a heavy step sounded in the middle of the room and a voice spoke in such a tone that everybody skipped x93Well I should like to know what all this means! Ive been all over the house and not a trace of anybody could I findx94 x93Oh father!x94 cried Mrs Whitney x93Van dear get up and get grandpapa a chairx94 x93No no!x94 said the old gentleman waving him off impatiently x93Im not going to stay; I must go and lie down My head is in a bad condition to-day; very bad indeedx94 he added x93Oh!x94 said Phronsie popping up her head and looking at him x93I must get right downx94 x93Whats the matter Phronsie?x94 asked Mrs Pepper trying to hold her back x93Oh but I mustx94 said Phronsie energetically wriggling x93My poor sick man wants me he doesx94 And flying out of her mothers arms she ran up to Mr King and standing on tiptoe said softly x93Ill rub your head grandpa dear poor sick man; yes I willx94 x93And youre the best childx94 cried the old gentleman catching her up and marching over to the other side of the room where there was a lounging chair x93There now you and I Phronsie will stay by ourselves Then my head will feel betterx94 And he sat down and drew her into his arms x93Does it ache very bad?x94 said Phronsie in a soft little voice Then reaching up she began to pat and smooth it gently with one little hand x93Very bad dear grandpa?x94 x93It wontx94 said the old gentleman x93if you only keep on taking care of it little Phronsiex94 x93Thenx94 said the child perfectly delighted x93Im going to take all care of you grandpa always!x94 x93So you shall so you shall!x94 cried Mr King no less delighted than she was x93Mrs Pepper!x94 x93Sir?x94 said Mrs Pepper trying to answer which she couldnt do very well surrounded as she was by the crowd of little chatterers x93Yes Sir; excuse me what is it sir?x94 x93Weve got to come to an understanding about this thingx94 said the old gentleman x93and I cant talk much to-day because my headache wont allow itx94 Here the worried look came into Phronsies face again and she began to try to smooth his head with both little hands x93And so I must say it all in as few words as possiblex94 he continued x93What is it sir?x94 again asked Mrs Pepper wonderingly x93Well the fact is Ive got to have somebody who will keep this house Now Marian not a word!x94 as he saw symptoms of Mrs Whitneys joining in the conversation x93Youve been good; just as good as can be under the circumstances; but Mason will be home in the fall and then I suppose youll have to go with him Now Ix94 said the old gentleman forgetting all about his head and straightening himself up suddenly in the chair x93am going to get things into shape so that the house will be kept for all of us; so that we can come or go And how can I do it better than to have the Peppers--you Mrs Pepper and all your children--come here and live and--x94 x93Oh father!x94 cried Jasper rushing up to him; and flinging his arms around his neck he gave him such a hug as he hadnt received for many a day x93Goodness Jasper!x94 cried his father feeling of his throat x93How can you express your feelings so violently! And besides you interruptx94 x93Beg pardon sirx94 said Jasper swallowing his excitement and trying to control his eagerness x93Do you say yes Mrs Pepper?x94 queried the old gentleman impatiently x93I must get this thing fixed up to-day Im really too ill to be worried maamx94 x93Why sirx94 stammered Mrs Pepper x93I dont know what to say I couldnt think of imposing all my children on you and--x94 x93Imposing! Whos talking of imposing!x94 said Mr King in a loud key x93I want my house kept; will you live here and keep it? That is the questionx94 x93But sirx94 began Mrs Pepper again x93you dont think--x94 x93I do think; I tell you maam I do thinkx94 snapped the old gentleman x93Its just because I have thought that Ive made up my mind Will you do it Mrs Pepper?x94 x93What are you goin to do mamsie?x94 asked Joel quickly x93I dont know as Im going to do anything yetx94 said poor Mrs Pepper who was almost stunned x93To come here and live!x94 cried Jasper unable to keep still any longer--and springing to the children x93Dont you want to Joe?x94 x93To live!x94 screamed Joel x93Oh whickety yes! Do ma do come here and live--do!x94 x93To live?x94 echoed Phronsie over in the old gentlemans lap x93In this be-yew-ti-ful place? Oh oh!x94 x93Oh mamsie!x94 that was all Polly could say And even Ben had his arms around his mothers neck whispering x93Dox94 into her ear while little Davie got into her lap and teased her with all his might x93What shall I do!x94 cried the poor woman x93Did ever anybody see the like?x94 x93Its the very best thing you could possibly dox94 cried the old gentleman x93Dont you see its for the childrens advantage? Theyll get such educations Mrs Pepper as you want for them And it accommodates me immensely What obstacle can there be to it?x94 x93If I was only sure twas best?x94 said Mrs Pepper doubtfully x93Oh dear Mrs Pepperx94 said Mrs Whitney laying her hand on hers x93Can you doubt it?x94 x93Thenx94 said Mr King getting up but still holding on to Phronsie x93well consider it settled This is your home childrenx94 he said waving his hand at the five little Peppers in a bunch And having thus summarily disposed of the whole business he marched out with Phronsie on his shoulder POLLYS DISMAL MORNING Everything had gone wrong with Polly that day It began with her boots Of all things in the world that tried Pollys patience most were the troublesome little black buttons that originally adorned those useful parts of her clothing and that were fondly supposed to be there when needed But they never were The little black things seemed to be invested with a special spite for one by one they would hop off on the slightest provocation and go rolling over the floor just when she was in her most terrible hurry compelling her to fly for needle and thread on the instant For one thing Mrs Pepper was very strict about--and that was Polly should do nothing else till the buttons were all on again and the boots buttoned up firm and snug x93Oh dear!x94 said Polly sitting down on the floor and pulling on her stockings x93There now see that hateful old shoe mamsie!x94 And she thrust out one foot in dismay x93Whats the matter with it?x94 said Mrs Pepper straightening the things on the bureau x93You havent worn it out already Polly?x94 x93Oh nox94 said Polly with a little laugh x93I hope not yet but its these dreadful hateful old buttons!x94 And she twitched the boot off from her foot with such an impatient little pull that three or four more went flying under the bed x93There now--theres a lot more I dont care! I wish theyd all go; they might as well!x94 she cried tossing that boot on the floor in intense scorn while she investigated the state of the other one x93Are they all off?x94 asked Phronsie pulling herself up out of a little heap in the middle of the bed and leaning over the side where she viewed Polly sorrowfully x93Every one Polly?x94 x93Nox94 said Polly x93but I wish they were mean old things; when I was going down to play a duet with Jasper! We should have had a good long time before breakfast Oh maynt I go just once mamsie? Nobodyll see me if I tuck my foot under the piano; and I can sew em on afterwards--therell be plenty of time Do just once mamsie!x94 x93Nox94 said Mrs Pepper firmly x93there isnt any time but now And piano playing isnt very nice when youve got to stick your toes under it to keep your shoes onx94 x93Well thenx94 grumbled Polly hopping around in her stocking-feet x93where is the work-basket mamsie? Oh--here it is on the window-seatx94 A rattle of spools scissors and necessary utensils showed plainly that Polly had found it followed by a jumble of words and despairing ejaculations as she groped hurriedly under chairs and tables to collect the scattered contents When she got back with a very red face she found Phronsie who had crawled out of bed sitting down on the floor in her little nightgown and examining the boot with profound interest x93I can sew em Pollyx94 she said holding up her hand for the big needle that Polly was trying to thread--x93I can now truly; let me Polly do!x94 x93Dear no!x94 said Polly with a little laugh beginning to be very much ashamed x93What could you do with your little mites of hands pulling this big thread through that old leather? There scamper into bed again; youll catch cold out here x93Tisnt very coldx94 said Phronsie tucking up her toes under the night-gown but Polly hurried her into bed where she curled herself up under the clothes watching her make a big knot But the knot didnt stay; for when Polly drew up the long thread triumphantly to the end--out it flew and away the button hopped again as if glad to be released And then the thread kinked horribly and got all twisted up in disagreeable little snarls that took all Pollys patience to unravel x93Its because youre in such a hurryx94 said Mrs Pepper who was getting Phronsies clothes And coming over across the room she got down on one knee and looked over Pollys shoulder x93There now let mother see whats the matterx94 x93Oh dearx94 said Polly resigning the needle with a big sigh and leaning back to take a good stretch followed by Phronsies sympathizing eyes; x93they neverll be on! And there goes the first bell!x94 as the loud sounds under Janes vigorous ringing pealed up over the stairs x93There wont be time anyway now! I wish there wasnt such a thing as shoes in the world!x94 And she gave a flounce and sat up straight in front of her mother x93Polly!x94 said Mrs Pepper sternly deftly fastening the little buttons tightly into place with quick firm stitches x93better be glad youve got them to sew at all There now here they are Those wont come off in a hurry!x94 x93Oh mamsie!x94 cried Polly ignoring for a moment the delights of the finished shoe to fling her arms around her mothers neck and give her a good hug x93Youre just the splendidest goodest mamsie in all the world And Im a hateful cross old bear so I am!x94 she cried remorsefully buttoning herself into her boots Which done she flew at the rest of her preparations and tried to make up for lost time But twas all of no use The day seemed to be always just racing ahead of her and turning a corner before she could catch up to it and Ben and the other boys only caught dissolving views of her as she flitted through halls or over stairs x93Wheres Polly?x94 said Percy at last coming with great dissatisfaction in his voice to the library door x93Weve called her I guess a million times and she wont hurryx94 x93What do you want to have her do?x94 asked Jasper looking up from the sofa where he had flung himself with a book x93Why she said shed make Van and me our sails you knowx94 said Percy holding up a rather forlorn looking specimen of a boat but which the boys had carved with the greatest enthusiasm x93and we want her nowx94 x93Cant you let her alone till shes ready to come?x94 said Jasper quickly x93Youre always teasing her to do somethingx94 he added x93I didnt teasex94 said Percy indignantly coming up to the sofa boat in hand to enforce his words x93She said shed love to do em so there Jasper King!x94 x93Coming! coming!x94 sang Polly over the stairs and bobbing into the library x93Oh--here you are Percy! I couldnt come before; mamsie wanted me Now says I for the sailsx94 And she began to flap out a long white piece of cotton cloth on the table to trim into just the desired shape x93That isnt the wayx94 said Percy crowding up the brightness that had flashed over his face at Pollys appearance beginning to fade x93Hoh! those wont be good for anything--those aint sailsx94 x93I havent finishedx94 said Polly snipping away vigorously and longing to get back to mamsie x93Wait till theyre done; then theyll be good--as good as can be!x94 x93And its bad enough to have to make themx94 put in Jasper flinging aside his book and rolling over to watch them x93without having to be found fault with every second Percyx94 x93Theyre too bigx94 said Percy surveying them critically and then looking at his boat x93Oh that corners coming offx94 cried Polly cheerfully giving it a sharp cut that sent it flying on the floor x93And they wont be too big when theyre done Percy all hemmed and everything Therex94 as she held one up for inspection x93thats just the way I used to make Bens and mine when we sailed boatsx94 x93Is it?x94 asked Percy looking with more respect at the piece of cloth Polly was waving alluringly before him x93Just exactly like it Polly?x94 x93Yesx94 said Polly laying it down again for a pattern--x93oh how does this go--oh--thats it there--yes this is just exactly like Bensies and mine--that was when I was ever so little; and then I used to make Joels and Davies afterwards and--x94 x93And were theirs just like this?x94 asked Percy laying his hand on the sail she had finished cutting out x93Pre-ciselyx94 said Polly with a pin in her mouth x93Just as like as two peas Percy Whitneyx94 x93Then I like themx94 cried Percy veering round and regarding them with great satisfaction--as Van bounded in with a torrent of complaints and great disappointment in every line of his face x93Oh now thats too bad!x94 he cried seeing Polly fold up the remaining bits of cloth and pick up the scraps on the floor x93And youve gone and let her cut out every one of em and never told me a word! Youre a mean old hateful thing Percy Whitney!x94 x93Oh dont!x94 said Polly on her knees on the floor x93I forgot--x94 began Percy x93and she cut em so quick--and--x94 x93And Ive been waitingx94 said Van in a loud wrathful key x93and waiting--and waiting!x94 x93Never mind Vanx94 said Jasper consolingly getting off from the sofa and coming up to the table x93Theyre done and done beautifully arent they?x94 he said holding up one But this only proved fresh fuel for the fire of Vans indignation x93And you shant have em so!x94 he cried making a lunge at the one on the table x93for I made most of the boat there!x94 x93Oh no you didnt!x94 cried Percy in the greatest alarm hanging on to the boat in his hand x93I cut--all the keel--and the bow--and--x94 x93Oh dear!x94 said Polly in extreme dismay looking at Jasper x93Come Ill tell you what Ill do boysx94 x93What?x94 said Van cooling off a little and allowing Percy to edge into a corner with the beloved boat and one sail x93What will you Polly?x94 x93Ill make you another pair of sailsx94 said Polly groaning within herself as she thought of the wasted minutes x93and then you can see me cut em Vanx94 x93Will you reallyx94 he said delight coming all over his flushed face x93Yes I willx94 cried Polly x93wait a minute till I get some more clothx94 And she started for the door x93Oh now thats too bad!x94 said Jasper x93To have to cut more of those tiresome old things! Van let her off!x94 x93Oh no I wont! I wont!x94 he cried in the greatest alarm running up to her as she stood by the door x93You did say so Polly! You know you did!x94 x93Of course I did Vannyx94 said Polly smiling down into his eager face x93and well have a splendid pair in just--one--minute!x94 she sang And so the sails were cut out and the hems turned down and basted and tucked away into Pollys little work-basket ready for the sewing on the morrow And then Mr King came in and took Jasper off with him; and the two Whitney boys went up to mamma for a story; and Polly sat down in mamsies room to tackle her French exercise POLLYS BIG BUNDLE The room was very quiet; but presently Phronsie strayed in and seeing Polly studying climbed up in a chair by the window to watch the birds hop over the veranda and pick up worms in the grass beside the carriage drive And then came Mrs Pepper with the big mending basket and ensconced herself opposite by the table; and nothing was to be heard but the x93tick tickx94 of the clock and an occasional dropping of a spool of thread or scissors from the busy hands flying in and out among the stockings All of a sudden there was a great rustling in Cherrys cage that swung in the big window on the other side of the room And then he set up a loud and angry chirping flying up and down and opening his mouth as if he wanted to express his mind but couldnt and otherwise acting in a very strange and unaccountable manner x93Dear me!x94 said Mrs Pepper x93whats that?x94 x93Its Cherryx94 said Polly lifting up her head from x93Fasquellex94 x93and--oh dear me!x94 and flinging down the pile of books in her lap on a chair she rushed across the room and flew up to the cage and began to wildly gesticulate and explain and shower down on him every endearing name she could think of x93What is the matter?x94 asked her mother turning around in her chair in perfect astonishment x93What upon earth Polly!x94 x93How could I!x94 cried Polly in accents of despair not heeding her mothers question x93Oh mamsie will he die do you think?x94 x93I guess notx94 said Mrs Pepper laying down her work and coming up to the cage while Phronsie scrambled off from her chair and hurried to the scene x93Why he does act queer dont he? Praps hes been eating too much?x94 x93Eating!x94 said Polly x93oh mamsie he hasnt had anythingx94 And she pointed with shame and remorse to the seed-cup with only a few dried husks in the very bottom x93Oh Pollyx94 began Mrs Pepper; but seeing the look on her face she changed her tone for one more cheerful x93Well hurry and get him some now; hell be all right poor little thing in a minute There therex94 she said nodding persuasively at the cage x93you pretty creature you! so you shant be starvedx94 At the word x93starvedx94 Polly winced as though a pin had been pointed at her x93There isnt any mamsie in the housex94 she stammered; x93he had the last yesterdayx94 x93And you forgot him to-day?x94 asked Mrs Pepper with a look in her black eyes Polly didnt like x93Yesmx94 said poor Polly in a low voice x93Well he must have something right awayx94 said Mrs Pepper decidedly x93Thats certainx94 x93Ill run right down to Fletchers and get itx94 cried Polly x93Twont take me but a minute mamsie; Jaspers gone and Thomas too so Ive got to gox94 she added as she saw her mother hesitate x93If you could wait till Ben gets homex94 said Mrs Pepper slowly x93Im most afraid it will rain Pollyx94 x93Oh no mamsiex94 cried Polly feeling as if she could fly to the ends of the earth to atone and longing beside for the brisk walk down town Going up to the window she pointed triumphantly to the little bit of blue sky still visible x93There now see it cant rain yet awhilex94 x93Wellx94 said Mrs Pepper while Phronsie standing in a chair with her face pressed close to the cage was telling Cherry through the bars x93not to be hungry please dont!x94 which he didnt seem to mind in the least but went on screaming harder than ever! x93And besides tisnt much use to wait for Ben Nobody knows where hell get shoes to fit himself and Joe and Davie in one afternoon!

The cloud that had seemed but a cloud when she went in was now fast descending in big ominous sprinkles that told of a heavy shower to follow Quick and fast they came making everybody fly to the nearest shelter x93I dont carex94 said Polly to herself holding fast her little package x93Ill run and get in the car--then Ill be all rightx94 So she went on with nimble footsteps dodging the crowd and soon came to the corner A car was just in sight--that was fine! Polly put her hand in her pocket for her purse to have it all ready--but as quickly drew it out again and stared wildly at the car which she allowed to pass by Her pocket was empty! x93Oh dearx94 she said to herself as a sudden gust of wind blew around the corner and warned her to move on x93now what shall I do! Well I must hurry Nothing for it but to run now!x94 And secretly glad at the chance for a good hearty run along the hard pavements a thing she had been longing to do ever since she came to the city Polly gathered her bundle of seed up under her arm and set out for a jolly race She was enjoying it hugely when--a sudden turn of the corner brought her up against a gentleman who having his umbrella down to protect his face hadnt seen her till it was too late Polly never could tell how it was done; but the first thing she knew she was being helped up from the wet slippery pavement by a kind hand; and a gentlemans voice said in the deepest concern x93I beg your pardon; it was extremely careless in mex94 x93Its no matterx94 said Polly hopping up with a little laugh and straightening her hat x93Only--x94 and she began to look for her parcel that had been sent spinning x93What is it?x94 said the gentleman bending down and beginning to explore too in the darkness x93My bundlex94 began Polly x93Oh dear!x94 No need to ask for it now! There lay the paper wet and torn down at their feet The seed lay all over the pavement scattered far and wide even out to the puddles in the street And not a cent of money to get any more with! The rain that was falling around them as they stood there sent with the sound of every drop such a flood of misery into Pollys heart! x93What was it child?x94 asked the gentleman peering sharply to find out what the little shiny things were x93Bird-seedx94 gasped Polly x93Is that all?x94 said the gentleman with a happy laugh x93Im very gladx94 x93All!x94 Pollys heart stood still as she thought of Cherry stark and stiff in the bottom of his cage if he didnt get it soon x93Nowx94 said the kind tones briskly x93come little girl well make this all right speedily Lets see--heres a bird store Now thenx94 x93But sir--x94 began Polly holding back Even Cherry had better die than to do anything her mother wouldnt like But the gentleman already had her in the shop and was delighting the heart of the shop-keeper by ordering him to do up a big package of all kinds of seed And then he added a cunning arrangement for birds to swing in and two or three other things that didnt have anything to do with birds at all And then they came out on the wet slippery street again x93Now then little girlx94 said the gentleman tucking the bundle under his arm and opening the umbrella; then he took hold of Pollys hand who by this time was glad of a protector x93Where do you live? For Im going to take you safely home this time where umbrellas cant run into youx94 x93Oh!x94 said Polly with a little skip x93Thank you sir! Its up to Mr Kings; and--x94 x93What!x94 said the gentleman stopping short in the midst of an immense puddle and staring at her x93Mr Jasper Kings?x94 x93I dont know sirx94 said Polly x93what his other name is Yes it must be Jasper; thats what Jappys is anywayx94 she added with a little laugh wishing very much that she could see Jappy at that identical moment x93Jappy!x94 said the stranger still standing as if petrified x93And are there little Whitney children in the same house!x94 x93Oh yesx94 said Polly raising her clear brown eyes up at him The gas lighter was just beginning his rounds and the light from a neighboring lamp flashed full on Pollys face as she spoke showing just how clear and brown the eyes were x93Theres Percy and Van and little Dick--oh hes so cunning!x94 she cried impulsively The gentlemans face looked very queer just then; but he merely said x93Why you must be Polly?x94 x93Yes sir I amx94 said Polly pleased to think he knew her And then she told him how shed forgotten Cherrys seed and all about it x93And oh sirx94 she said and her voice began to tremble x93Mamsiell be so frightened if I dont get there soon!x94 x93Im going up there myself so that it all happens very nicelyx94 said the gentleman commencing to start off briskly and grasping her hand tighter x93Now then Pollyx94 So off they went at a very fast pace; she skipping through the puddles that his long even strides carried him safely over chattered away by his side under the umbrella and answered his many questions and altogether got so very well acquainted that by the time they turned in at the old stone gateway she felt as if she had known him for years And there the first thing they either of them saw down in a little corner back of the tall evergreens was a small heap that rose as they splashed up the carriage-drive and resolved itself into a very red dress and a very white apron as it rushed impulsively up and flung itself into Pollys wet arms x93And I was so tired waiting Polly!x94 x93Oh dear me Phronsie!x94 cried Polly huddling her up from the dark wet ground x93Youll catch your death! What will mamsie say!x94 The stranger amazed at this new stage of the proceedings was vainly trying to hold the umbrella over both till the procession could move on again x93Oh!x94 cried Phronsie shaking her yellow head decidedly x93theyre all looking for you Pollyx94 She pointed one finger solemnly up to the big carved door as she spoke At that Polly gathered her up close and began to walk with rapid footsteps up the path x93Do let me carry you little girlx94 said Pollys kind friend persuasively bending down to the little face on Pollys neck x93Oh no no no!x94 said Phronsie at each syllable grasping Polly around the throat in perfect terror and waving him off with a very crumpled mangy bit of paper that had already done duty to wipe off the copious tears during her anxious watch x93Dont let him Polly dont!x94 x93There shant anything hurt youx94 said Polly kissing her reassuringly and stepping briskly off with her burden just as the door burst open and Joel flew out on the veranda steps followed by the rest of the troop in the greatest state of excitement x93Oh whickety! shes come!x94 he shouted springing up to her over the puddles and crowding under the umbrella x93Whered you get Phronsie?x94 he asked standing quite still at sight of the little feet tucked up to get out of the rain And without waiting for an answer he turned and shot back into the house proclaiming in stentorian tones x93Ma Pollys come--an shes got Phronsie--an an awful big man--and theyre out by the gate!x94 x93Phronsie!x94 said Mrs Pepper springing to her feet x93why I thought she was up-stairs with Janex94 x93Now somebodyx94 exclaimed old Mr King who sat by the library table vainly trying to read a newspaper which he now threw down in extreme irritation as he rose quickly and went to the door to welcome the wanderers x93somebody ought to watch that poor child whose business it is to know where she is! Shes caught her death-cold no doubt no doubt!x94 Outside in the rain the children revolved around and around Polly and Phronsie hugging and kissing them until nobody could do much more than breathe not seeming to notice the stranger who stood quietly waiting till such time as he could be heard At last in a lull in the scramble as they were dragging Polly and her burden up the steps each wild for the honor of escorting her into the house he cried out in laughing tones x93Isnt anybody going to kiss me I wonder!x94 The two little Whitneys who were eagerly clutching Pollys arms turned around; and Percy rubbed his eyes in a puzzled way as Joel said stopping a minute to look up at the tall figure x93We dont ever kiss strangers--mamsies told us not tox94 x93For shame Joey!x94 cried Polly feeling her face grow dreadfully red in the darkness x93the gentlemans been so kind to me!x94 x93Youre right my boyx94 said the stranger laughing and bending down to Joels upturned sturdy countenance at the same instant that Mrs Pepper flung open the big door and a bright warm light fell straight across his handsome face And then--well then Percy gave a violent bound and upsetting Joel as he did so wriggled his way down the steps--at the same time that Van on Pollys other side rushed up to the gentleman x93Papa--oh papa!x94 Polly half way up the steps turned around and then at the rush of feeling that gathered at her heart sat right down on the wet slippery step x93Why Polly Pepper!x94 exclaimed Joel not minding his own upset x93Youre right in all the slush--mother wont like it I tell you!x94 x93Hush!x94 cried Polly catching his arm x93hes come--oh Joel--hes come!x94 x93Who?x94 cried Joel staring around blindly x93who Polly?x94 Polly had just opened her lips to explain when Mr Kings portly handsome figure appeared in the doorway x93Do come in children--why--good gracious Mason!x94 x93Yesx94 cried the stranger lightly dropping his big bundle and umbrella as he passed in the door with his little sons clinging to him x93Where is Marian?x94 x93Why didnt you write?x94 asked the old gentleman testily x93These surprises arent the right sort of thingsx94 and he began to feel vigorously of his heart x93Here Mrs Pepper be so good as to call Mrs Whitneyx94 x93Pepper! Pepper!x94 repeated Mr Whitney perplexedly x93Shes coming--I hear her up-stairsx94 cried Van Whitney x93Oh let me tell her!x94 He struggled to get down from his fathers arms as he said this x93No I shall--I heard her first!x94 cried Percy x93Oh dear me! Grandpapas going to!x94 Mr King advanced to the foot of the staircase as his daughter all unconscious ran down with a light step and a smile on her face x93Has Polly come?x94 she asked seeing only her father x93Yesx94 replied the old gentleman shortly x93and shes brought a big bundle Marian!x94 x93A big bundle?x94 she repeated wonderingly and gazing at him x93A very big bundlex94 he said and taking hold of her shoulders he turned her around on--her husband So Polly and Phronsie crept in unnoticed after all x93I wish Ben was herex94 said little Davie capering around the Whitney group x93an Jappy I do!x94 x93Where are they!x94 asked Polly x93Dont knowx94 said Joel tugging at his shoe-string x93See--arent these prime!x94 He held up a shining black shoe fairly bristling with newness for Polly to admire x93Splendidx94 she cried heartily; x93but where are the boys?x94 x93They went after youx94 said Davie x93after we came home with our shoesx94 x93No they didntx94 contradicted Joel flatly; and sitting down on the floor he began to tie and untie his new possessions x93When we came home Ben drew us pictures--lots of em--dont you know?x94 x93Oh yesx94 said Davie nodding his head x93so he did; that was when we all cried cause you werent home Pollyx94 x93He drawed me a be-yew-tiful onex94 cried Phronsie holding up her mangy bit; x93see Polly see!x94 x93Thats the little brown housex94 said Davie looking over her shoulder as Phronsie put it carefully into Pollys hand x93Its all washed outx94 said Polly smoothing it out x93when you staid out in the rainx94 Phronsies face grew very grave at that x93Bad naughty old rainx94 she said and then she began to cry as hard as she could x93Oh dear dont!x94 cried Polly in dismay trying her best to stop her x93oh Phronsie do stop!x94 she implored pointing into the next room whence the sound of happy voices issued x93theyll all hear you!x94 But Phronsie in her grief didnt care but wailed on steadily x93Who is it anyway?x94 cried Joel tired of admiring his precious shoes and getting up to hear them squeak x93that great big man you know Polly that came in with you?x94 x93Why I thought I told youx94 said Polly at her wits end over Phronsie x93Its Percy and Vans father Joey!x94 x93Whockey!x94 cried Joel completely stunned x93really and truly Polly Pepper?x94 x93Really and trulyx94 cried Polly bundling Phronsie up in her arms to lay the little wet cheek against hers x93Then Im going to peekx94 cried Joel squeaking across the floor to carry his threat into execution x93Oh you mustnt Joe!x94 cried Polly frightened lest he should x93Come right back or Ill tell mamsie!x94 x93Theyre all comin in anywayx94 cried little Davie delightedly and scuttling over to Pollys side x93And here are the little friends Ive heard so much about!x94 cried Mr Whitney coming in amongst them x93Oh you neednt introduce me to Polly--she brought me home!x94 x93Theyre all Peppersesx94 said Percy waving his hand and doing the business up at one stroke x93Only the best of em isnt herex94 observed Van rather ungallantly x93he draws perfectly elegant papa!x94 x93I like Polly best I do!x94 cried little Dick tumbling after x93Peppers!x94 again repeated Mr Whitney in a puzzled way x93And here is Mrs Pepperx94 said old Mr King pompously drawing her forward x93the childrens mother and--x94 But here Mrs Pepper began to act in a very queer way rubbing her eyes and twisting one corner of her black apron in a decidedly nervous manner that as the old gentleman looked up he saw with astonishment presently communicated itself to the gentleman opposite x93Is itx94 said Mr Whitney putting out his hand and grasping the hard toil-worn one in the folds of the apron x93is it cousin Mary?x94 x93And arent you cousin John?x94 she asked the tears in her bright black eyes x93Of all things in this world!x94 cried the old gentleman waving his head helplessly from one to the other x93Will somebody have the extreme goodness to tell us what all this means?x94 At this the little Peppers crowded around their mother and into all the vacant places they could find to get near the fascinating scene x93Wellx94 said Mr Whitney sitting down and drawing his wife to his side x93its a long story You see when I was a little youngster and--x94 x93You were John Whitney thenx94 put in Mrs Pepper slyly x93Thats the reason I never knew when they were all talking of Mason Whitneyx94 x93John Whitney I wasx94 said Mr Whitney laughing x93or rather Johnny and Jack But Grandmother Mason when I grew older wanted me called by my middle name to please grandfather But to go back--when I was a little shaver about as big as Percy here--x94 x93Oh papa!x94 began Percy deprecatingly To be called x93a little shaverx94 before all the others!

Does she mean it?x94 cried Percy in the greatest excitement x93As true as everything?x94 demanded Joel crowding in between them x93As true as--truth!x94 said the old gentleman solemnly patting the childs little fat hand x93So make the most of itx94 x93Oh!x94 said Polly with a long sigh And then Jasper and she took hold of hands and had a good spin! Joel turned around with two big eyes on Percy x93Were cousins!x94 he said x93I know itx94 said Percy x93and sos Van!x94 x93Yesx94 said Van flying up x93and Im cousin to Polly too--thats best!x94 x93Cant I be a Cousin?x94 cried little Dick crowding up with two red cheeks x93Isnt anybody going to be a cousin to me too?x94 x93Everybody but Jasperx94 said the old gentleman laughing heartily at them x93You and I my boyx94 he turned to his son x93are left out in the coldx94 At this a scream loud and terrible to hear struck upon them all as Joel flung himself flat on the floor x93Isnt Jappy--our--cousin?

Do somebody stop him!x94 x93Joelx94 said Jasper leaning over him and trying to help Polly lift him up x93Ill tell you how well fix it! Ill be your brother Thats best of all--brother to Polly and Ben and the whole of you--then well see!x94 Joel bolted up at that and began to smile through the tears running down the rosy face x93Will you really?x94 he said x93just like Ben--and everything?x94 x93I cant be as good as Benx94 said Jappy laughing x93but Ill be a real brother like himx94 x93Phoo--phoo! Then I dont care!x94 cried Joel wiping off the last tear on the back of his chubby hand x93Now I guess were bettern youx94 he exclaimed with a triumphant glance over at the little Whitneys as he began to make the new shoes skip at a lively pace up and down the long room x93Oh dear!x94 they both cried in great distress x93Now papa Jappys going to be Joeys brother--and he isnt anything but our old uncle! Make him be ours more papa do!x94 And then Polly sprang up x93Oh! oh--deary me!x94 And she rushed out into the hall and began to tug violently at the big bundle tossed down in a corner x93Cherryll die--Cherryll die!x94 she cried x93do somebody help me off with the string!x94 But Polly already had it off by the time Jaspers knife was half out of his pocket and was kneeling down on the floor scooping out a big handful of the seed x93Dont hurry so Pollyx94 said Jasper as she jumped up to fly up-stairs x93Hes had some a perfect age--hes all rightx94 x93What!x94 said Polly stopping so suddenly that two or three little seeds flew out of the outstretched hand and went dancing away to the foot of the stairs by themselves x93Oh I heard him scolding away there when I first came homex94 said Jasper x93so I just ran down a block or two and got him somex94 x93Is that all there is in that big bundle?x94 said Joel in a disappointed tone who had followed with extreme curiosity to see its contents x93Phoo!--thats no fun--old bird-seed!x94 x93I knowx94 said Polly with a gay little laugh pointing with the handful of seed into the library x93but I shouldnt have met the other big bundle if it hadnt have been for this Joe!x94 End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Five Little Peppers And How They Grew by Margaret Sidney *** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK FIVE LITTLE PEPPERS *** *****
