She was constantly in a quite justifiable terror lest we should be lost or killed; she must have felt great relief when she reached Charlottetown and handed us over to the keeping of Uncle Alec Indeed she said as much The fat one isnt so bad He isnt so quick to move and get out of your sight while youre winking as the thin one But the only safe way to travel with those young ones would be to have em both tied to you with a short rope--a MIGHTY short rope The fat one was Felix who was very sensitive about his plumpness He was always taking exercises to make him thin with the dismal result that he became fatter all the time He vowed that he didnt care; but he DID care terribly and he glowered at Mrs MacLaren in a most undutiful fashion He had never liked her since the day she had told him he would soon be as broad as he was long For my own part I was rather sorry to see her going; and she cried over us and wished us well; but we had forgotten all about her by the time we reached the open country driving along one on either side of Uncle Alec whom we loved from the moment we saw him He was a small man with thin delicate features close-clipped gray beard and large tired blue eyes--fathers eyes over again We knew that Uncle Alec was fond of children and was heart-glad to welcome Alans boys We felt at home with him and were not afraid to ask him questions on any subject that came uppermost in our minds We became very good friends with him on that twenty-four mile drive Much to our disappointment it was dark when we reached Carlisle--too dark to see anything very distinctly as we drove up the lane of the old King homestead on the hill Behind us a young moon was hanging over southwestern meadows of spring-time peace but all about us were the soft moist shadows of a May night We peered eagerly through the gloom Theres the big willow Bev whispered Felix excitedly as we turned in at the gate There it was in truth--the tree Grandfather King had planted when he returned one evening from ploughing in the brook field and stuck the willow switch he had used all day in the soft soil by the gate It had taken root and grown; our father and our uncles and aunts had played in its shadow; and now it was a massive thing with a huge girth of trunk and great spreading boughs each of them as large as a tree in itself Im going to climb it to-morrow I said joyfully Off to the right was a dim branching place which we knew was the orchard; and on our left among sibilant spruces and firs was the old whitewashed house--from which presently a light gleamed through an open door and Aunt Janet a big bustling sonsy woman with full-blown peony cheeks came to welcome us Soon after we were at supper in the kitchen with its low dark raftered ceiling from which substantial hams and flitches of bacon were hanging Everything was just as father had described it We felt that we had come home leaving exile behind us Felicity Cecily and Dan were sitting opposite us staring at us when they thought we would be too busy eating to see them We tried to stare at them when THEY were eating; and as a result we were always catching each other at it and feeling cheap and embarrassed Dan was the oldest; he was my age--thirteen He was a lean freckled fellow with rather long lank brown hair and the shapely King nose We recognized it at once His mouth was his own however for it was like to no mouth on either the King or the Ward side; and nobody would have been anxious to claim it for it was an undeniably ugly one--long and narrow and twisted But it could grin in friendly fashion and both Felix and I felt that we were going to like Dan Felicity was twelve She had been called after Aunt Felicity who was the twin sister of Uncle Felix Aunt Felicity and Uncle Felix as father had often told us had died on the same day far apart and were buried side by side in the old Carlisle graveyard We had known from Aunt Olivias letters that Felicity was the beauty of the connection and we had been curious to see her on that account She fully justified our expectations She was plump and dimpled with big dark-blue heavy-lidded eyes soft feathery golden curls and a pink and white skin-- the King complexion The Kings were noted for their noses and complexion Felicity had also delightful hands and wrists At every turn of them a dimple showed itself It was a pleasure to wonder what her elbows must be like She was very nicely dressed in a pink print and a frilled muslin apron; and we understood from something Dan said that she had dressed up in honour of our coming This made us feel quite important So far as we knew no feminine creatures had ever gone to the pains of dressing up on our account before Cecily who was eleven was pretty also--or would have been had Felicity not been there Felicity rather took the colour from other girls Cecily looked pale and thin beside her; but she had dainty little features smooth brown hair of satin sheen and mild brown eyes with just a hint of demureness in them now and again We remembered that Aunt Olivia had written to father that Cecily was a true Ward--she had no sense of humour We did not know what this meant but we thought it was not exactly complimentary Still we were both inclined to think we would like Cecily better than Felicity To be sure Felicity was a stunning beauty But with the swift and unerring intuition of childhood which feels in a moment what it sometimes takes maturity much time to perceive we realized that she was rather too well aware of her good looks In brief we saw that Felicity was vain Its a wonder the Story Girl isnt over to see you said Uncle Alec Shes been quite wild with excitement about your coming She hasnt been very well all day explained Cecily and Aunt Olivia wouldnt let her come out in the night air She made her go to bed instead The Story Girl was awfully disappointed Who is the Story Girl? asked Felix Oh Sara--Sara Stanley We call her the Story Girl partly because shes such a hand to tell stories--oh I cant begin to describe it--and partly because Sara Ray who lives at the foot of the hill often comes up to play with us and it is awkward to have two girls of the same name in the same crowd Besides Sara Stanley doesnt like her name and shed rather be called the Story Girl Dan speaking for the first time rather sheepishly volunteered the information that Peter had also been intending to come over but had to go home to take some flour to his mother instead Peter? I questioned I had never heard of any Peter He is your Uncle Rogers handy boy said Uncle Alec His name is Peter Craig and he is a real smart little chap But hes got his share of mischief that same lad He wants to be Felicitys beau said Dan slyly Dont talk silly nonsense Dan said Aunt Janet severely Felicity tossed her golden head and shot an unsisterly glance at Dan I wouldnt be very likely to have a hired boy for a beau she observed We saw that her anger was real not affected Evidently Peter was not an admirer of whom Felicity was proud We were very hungry boys; and when we had eaten all we could--and oh what suppers Aunt Janet always spread!--we discovered that we were very tired also--too tired to go out and explore our ancestral domains as we would have liked to do despite the dark We were quite willing to go to bed; and presently we found ourselves tucked away upstairs in the very room looking out eastward into the spruce grove which father had once occupied Dan shared it with us sleeping in a bed of his own in the opposite corner The sheets and pillow-slips were fragrant with lavender and one of Grandmother Kings noted patchwork quilts was over us The window was open and we heard the frogs singing down in the swamp of the brook meadow We had heard frogs sing in Ontario of course; but certainly Prince Edward Island frogs were more tuneful and mellow Or was it simply the glamour of old family traditions and tales which was over us lending its magic to all sights and sounds around us? This was home--fathers home--OUR home! We had never lived long enough in any one house to develop a feeling of affection for it; but here under the roof-tree built by Great-Grandfather King ninety years ago that feeling swept into our boyish hearts and souls like a flood of living sweetness and tenderness Just think those are the very frogs father listened to when he was a little boy whispered Felix They can hardly be the SAME frogs I objected doubtfully not feeling very certain about the possible longevity of frogs Its twenty years since father left home Well theyre the descendants of the frogs he heard said Felix and theyre singing in the same swamp Thats near enough Our door was open and in their room across the narrow hall the girls were preparing for bed and talking rather more loudly than they might have done had they realized how far their sweet shrill voices carried What do you think of the boys? asked Cecily Beverley is handsome but Felix is too fat answered Felicity promptly Felix twitched the quilt rather viciously and grunted But I began to think I would like Felicity It might not be altogether her fault that she was vain How could she help it when she looked in the mirror? I think theyre both nice and nice looking said Cecily Dear little soul! I wonder what the Story Girl will think of them said Felicity as if after all that was the main thing Somehow we too felt that it was We felt that if the Story Girl did not approve of us it made little difference who else did or did not I wonder if the Story Girl is pretty said Felix aloud No she isnt said Dan instantly from across the room But youll think she is while shes talking to you Everybody does Its only when you go away from her that you find out she isnt a bit pretty after all The girls door shut with a bang Silence fell over the house We drifted into the land of sleep wondering if the Story Girl would like us CHAPTER II A QUEEN OF HEARTS I wakened shortly after sunrise The pale May sunshine was showering through the spruces and a chill inspiring wind was tossing the boughs about Felix wake up I whispered shaking him Whats the matter? he murmured reluctantly Its morning Lets get up and go down and out I cant wait another minute to see the places father has told us of We slipped out of bed and dressed without arousing Dan who was still slumbering soundly his mouth wide open and his bed-clothes kicked off on the floor I had hard work to keep Felix from trying to see if he could shy a marble into that tempting open mouth I told him it would waken Dan who would then likely insist on getting up and accompanying us and it would be so much nicer to go by ourselves for the first time Everything was very still as we crept downstairs Out in the kitchen we heard some one presumably Uncle Alec lighting the fire; but the heart of house had not yet begun to beat for the day We paused a moment in the hall to look at the big Grandfather clock It was not going but it seemed like an old familiar acquaintance to us with the gilt balls on its three peaks; the little dial and pointer which would indicate the changes of the moon and the very dent in its wooden door which father had made when he was a boy by kicking it in a fit of naughtiness Then we opened the front door and stepped out rapture swelling in our bosoms There was a rare breeze from the south blowing to meet us; the shadows of the spruces were long and clear-cut; the exquisite skies of early morning blue and wind-winnowed were over us; away to the west beyond the brook field was a long valley and a hill purple with firs and laced with still leafless beeches and maples Behind the house was a grove of fir and spruce a dim cool place where the winds were fond of purring and where there was always a resinous woodsy odour On the further side of it was a thick plantation of slender silver birches and whispering poplars; and beyond it was Uncle Rogers house Right before us girt about with its trim spruce hedge was the famous King orchard the history of which was woven into our earliest recollections We knew all about it from fathers descriptions and in fancy we had roamed in it many a time and oft It was now nearly sixty years since it had had its beginning when Grandfather King brought his bride home Before the wedding he had fenced off the big south meadow that sloped to the sun; it was the finest most fertile field on the farm and the neighbours told young Abraham King that he would raise many a fine crop of wheat in that meadow Abraham King smiled and being a man of few words said nothing; but in his mind he had a vision of the years to be and in that vision he saw not rippling acres of harvest gold but great leafy avenues of wide-spreading trees laden with fruit to gladden the eyes of children and grandchildren yet unborn It was a vision to develop slowly into fulfilment Grandfather King was in no hurry He did not set his whole orchard out at once for he wished it to grow with his life and history and be bound up with all of good and joy that should come to his household So the morning after he had brought his young wife home they went together to the south meadow and planted their bridal trees These trees were no longer living; but they had been when father was a boy and every spring bedecked themselves in blossom as delicately tinted as Elizabeth Kings face when she walked through the old south meadow in the morn of her life and love When a son was born to Abraham and Elizabeth a tree was planted in the orchard for him They had fourteen children in all and each child had its birth tree Every family festival was commemorated in like fashion and every beloved visitor who spent a night under their roof was expected to plant a tree in the orchard So it came to pass that every tree in it was a fair green monument to some love or delight of the vanished years And each grandchild had its tree there also set out by grandfather when the tidings of its birth reached him; not always an apple tree--perhaps it was a plum or cherry or pear But it was always known by the name of the person for whom or by whom it was planted; and Felix and I knew as much about Aunt Felicitys pears and Aunt Julias cherries and Uncle Alecs apples and the Rev Mr Scotts plums as if we had been born and bred among them And now we had come to the orchard; it was before us; we had only to open that little whitewashed gate in the hedge and we might find ourselves in its storied domain But before we reached the gate we glanced to our left along the grassy spruce-bordered lane which led over to Uncle Rogers; and at the entrance of that lane we saw a girl standing with a gray cat at her feet She lifted her hand and beckoned blithely to us; and the orchard forgotten we followed her summons For we knew that this must be the Story Girl; and in that gay and graceful gesture was an allurement not to be gainsaid or denied We looked at her as we drew near with such interest that we forgot to feel shy No she was not pretty She was tall for her fourteen years slim and straight; around her long white face--rather too long and too white--fell sleek dark-brown curls tied above either ear with rosettes of scarlet ribbon Her large curving mouth was as red as a poppy and she had brilliant almond-shaped hazel eyes; but we did not think her pretty Then she spoke; she said Good morning Never had we heard a voice like hers Never in all my life since have I heard such a voice I cannot describe it I might say it was clear; I might say it was sweet; I might say it was vibrant and far-reaching and bell-like; all this would be true but it would give you no real idea of the peculiar quality which made the Story Girls voice what it was If voices had colour hers would have been like a rainbow It made words LIVE Whatever she said became a breathing entity not a mere verbal statement or utterance Felix and I were too young to understand or analyze the impression it made upon us; but we instantly felt at her greeting that it WAS a good morning--a surpassingly good morning--the very best morning that had ever happened in this most excellent of worlds You are Felix and Beverley she went on shaking our hands with an air of frank comradeship which was very different from the shy feminine advances of Felicity and Cecily From that moment we were as good friends as if we had known each other for a hundred years I am glad to see you I was so disappointed I couldnt go over last night I got up early this morning though for I felt sure you would be up early too and that youd like to have me tell you about things I can tell things so much better than Felicity or Cecily Do you think Felicity is VERY pretty? Shes the prettiest girl I ever saw I said enthusiastically remembering that Felicity had called me handsome The boys all think so said the Story Girl not I fancied quite well pleased And I suppose she is She is a splendid cook too though she is only twelve I cant cook I am trying to learn but I dont make much progress Aunt Olivia says I havent enough natural gumption ever to be a cook; but Id love to be able to make as good cakes and pies as Felicity can make But then Felicity is stupid Its not ill-natured of me to say that Its just the truth and youd soon find it out for yourselves I like Felicity very well but she IS stupid Cecily is ever so much cleverer Cecilys a dear So is Uncle Alec; and Aunt Janet is pretty nice too What is Aunt Olivia like? asked Felix Aunt Olivia is very pretty She is just like a pansy--all velvety and purply and goldy Felix and I SAW somewhere inside of our heads a velvet and purple and gold pansy-woman just as the Story Girl spoke But is she NICE? I asked That was the main question about grown-ups Their looks mattered little to us She is lovely But she is twenty-nine you know Thats pretty old She doesnt bother me much Aunt Janet says that Id have no bringing up at all if it wasnt for her Aunt Olivia says children should just be let COME up--that everything else is settled for them long before they are born I dont understand that Do you? No we did not But it was our experience that grown-ups had a habit of saying things hard to understand What is Uncle Roger like? was our next question Well I like Uncle Roger said the Story Girl meditatively He is big and jolly But he teases people too much You ask him a serious question and you get a ridiculous answer He hardly ever scolds or gets cross though and THAT is something He is an old bachelor Doesnt he ever mean to get married? asked Felix I dont know Aunt Olivia wishes he would because shes tired keeping house for him and she wants to go to Aunt Julia in California But she says hell never get married because he is looking for perfection and when he finds her she wont have HIM By this time we were all sitting down on the gnarled roots of the spruces and the big gray cat came over and made friends with us He was a lordly animal with a silver-gray coat beautifully marked with darker stripes With such colouring most cats would have had white or silver feet; but he had four black paws and a black nose Such points gave him an air of distinction and marked him out as quite different from the common or garden variety of cats He seemed to be a cat with a tolerably good opinion of himself and his response to our advances was slightly tinged with condescension This isnt Topsy is it? I asked I knew at once that the question was a foolish one Topsy the cat of which father had talked had flourished thirty years before and all her nine lives could scarcely have lasted so long No but it is Topsys great-great-great-great-grandson said the Story Girl gravely His name is Paddy and he is my own particular cat We have barn cats but Paddy never associates with them I am very good friends with all cats They are so sleek and comfortable and dignified And it is so easy to make them happy Oh Im so glad you boys have come to live here Nothing ever happens here except days so we have to make our own good times We were short of boys before--only Dan and Peter to four girls FOUR girls? Oh yes Sara Ray Felicity mentioned her What is she like? Where does she live? Just down the hill You cant see the house for the spruce bush Sara is a nice girl Shes only eleven and her mother is dreadfully strict She never allows Sara to read a single story JUST you fancy! Saras conscience is always troubling her for doing things shes sure her mother wont approve but it never prevents her from doing them It only spoils her fun Uncle Roger says that a mother who wont let you do anything and a conscience that wont let you enjoy anything is an awful combination and he doesnt wonder Sara is pale and thin and nervous But between you and me I believe the real reason is that her mother doesnt give her half enough to eat Not that shes mean you know--but she thinks it isnt healthy for children to eat much or anything but certain things Isnt it fortunate we werent born into that sort of a family? I think its awfully lucky we were all born into the same family Felix remarked Isnt it? Ive often thought so And Ive often thought what a dreadful thing it would have been if Grandfather and Grandmother King had never got married to each other I dont suppose there would have been a single one of us children here at all; or if we were we would be part somebody else and that would be almost as bad When I think it all over I cant feel too thankful that Grandfather and Grandmother King happened to marry each other when there were so many other people they might have married Felix and I shivered We felt suddenly that we had escaped a dreadful danger--the danger of having been born somebody else But it took the Story Girl to make us realize just how dreadful it was and what a terrible risk we had run years before we or our parents either had existed Who lives over there? I asked pointing to a house across the fields Oh that belongs to the Awkward Man His name is Jasper Dale but everybody calls him the Awkward Man And they do say he writes poetry He calls his place Golden Milestone I know why because Ive read Longfellows poems He never goes into society because he is so awkward The girls laugh at him and he doesnt like it I know a story about him and Ill tell it to you sometime And who lives in that other house? asked Felix looking over the westering valley where a little gray roof was visible among the trees Old Peg Bowen Shes very queer She lives there with a lot of pet animals in winter and in summer she roams over the country and begs her meals They say she is crazy People have always tried to frighten us children into good behaviour by telling us that Peg Bowen would catch us if we didnt behave Im not so frightened of her as I once was but I dont think I would like to be caught by her Sara Ray is dreadfully scared of her Peter Craig says she is a witch and that he bets shes at the bottom of it when the butter wont come But I dont believe THAT Witches are so scarce nowadays There may be some somewhere in the world but its not likely there are any here right in Prince Edward Island They used to be very plenty long ago I know some splendid witch stories Ill tell you some day Theyll just make your blood freeze in your veins We hadnt a doubt of it If anybody could freeze the blood in our veins this girl with the wonderful voice could But it was a May morning and our young blood was running blithely in our veins We suggested a visit to the orchard would be more agreeable All right I know stories about it too she said as we walked across the yard followed by Paddy of the waving tail Oh arent you glad it is spring? The beauty of winter is that it makes you appreciate spring The latch of the gate clicked under the Story Girls hand and the next moment we were in the King orchard CHAPTER III LEGENDS OF THE OLD ORCHARD Outside of the orchard the grass was only beginning to grow green; but here sheltered by the spruce hedges from uncertain winds and sloping to southern suns it was already like a wonderful velvet carpet; the leaves on the trees were beginning to come out in woolly grayish clusters; and there were purple-pencilled white violets at the base of the Pulpit Stone Its all just as father described it said Felix with a blissful sigh and theres the well with the Chinese roof We hurried over to it treading on the spears of mint that were beginning to shoot up about it It was a very deep well and the curb was of rough undressed stones Over it the queer pagoda-like roof built by Uncle Stephen on his return from a voyage to China was covered with yet leafless vines Its so pretty when the vines leaf out and hang down in long festoons said the Story Girl The birds build their nests in it A pair of wild canaries come here every summer And ferns grow out between the stones of the well as far down as you can see The water is lovely Uncle Edward preached his finest sermon about the Bethlehem well where Davids soldiers went to get him water and he illustrated it by describing his old well at the homestead--this very well--and how in foreign lands he had longed for its sparkling water So you see it is quite famous Theres a cup just like the one that used to be here in fathers time exclaimed Felix pointing to an old-fashioned shallow cup of clouded blue ware on a little shelf inside the curb It is the very same cup said the Story Girl impressively Isnt it an amazing thing? That cup has been here for forty years and hundreds of people have drunk from it and it has never been broken Aunt Julia dropped it down the well once but they fished it up not hurt a bit except for that little nick in the rim I think it is bound up with the fortunes of the King family like the Luck of Edenhall in Longfellows poem It is the last cup of Grandmother Kings second best set Her best set is still complete Aunt Olivia has it You must get her to show it to you Its so pretty with red berries all over it and the funniest little pot-bellied cream jug Aunt Olivia never uses it except on a family anniversary We took a drink from the blue cup and then went to find our birthday trees We were rather disappointed to find them quite large sturdy ones It seemed to us that they should still be in the sapling stage corresponding to our boyhood Your apples are lovely to eat the Story Girl said to me but Felixs are only good for pies Those two big trees behind them are the twins trees--my mother and Uncle Felix you know The apples are so dead sweet that nobody but us children and the French boys can eat them And that tall slender tree over there with the branches all growing straight up is a seedling that came up of itself and NOBODY can eat its apples they are so sour and bitter Even the pigs wont eat them Aunt Janet tried to make pies of them once because she said she hated to see them going to waste But she never tried again She said it was better to waste apples alone than apples and sugar too And then she tried giving them away to the French hired men but they wouldnt even carry them home The Story Girls words fell on the morning air like pearls and diamonds Even her prepositions and conjunctions had untold charm hinting at mystery and laughter and magic bound up in everything she mentioned Apple pies and sour seedlings and pigs became straightway invested with a glamour of romance I like to hear you talk said Felix in his grave stodgy way Everybody does said the Story Girl coolly Im glad you like the way I talk But I want you to like ME too--AS WELL as you like Felicity and Cecily Not BETTER I wanted that once but Ive got over it I found out in Sunday School the day the minister taught our class that it was selfish But I want you to like me AS WELL Well I will for one said Felix emphatically I think he was remembering that Felicity had called him fat Cecily now joined us It appeared that it was Felicitys morning to help prepare breakfast therefore she could not come We all went to Uncle Stephens Walk This was a double row of apple trees running down the western side of the orchard Uncle Stephen was the first born of Abraham and Elizabeth King He had none of grandfathers abiding love for woods and meadows and the kindly ways of the warm red earth Grandmother King had been a Ward and in Uncle Stephen the blood of the seafaring race claimed its own To sea he must go despite the pleadings and tears of a reluctant mother; and it was from the sea he came to set out his avenue in the orchard with trees brought from a foreign land Then he sailed away again--and the ship was never heard of more The gray first came in grandmothers brown hair in those months of waiting The for the first time the orchard heard the sound of weeping and was consecrated by a sorrow When the blossoms come out its wonderful to walk here said the Story Girl Its like a dream of fairyland--as if you were walking in a kings palace The apples are delicious and in winter its a splendid place for coasting From the Walk we went to the Pulpit Stone--a huge gray boulder as high as a mans head in the southeastern corner It was straight and smooth in front but sloped down in natural steps behind with a ledge midway on which one could stand It had played an important part in the games of our uncles and aunts being fortified castle Indian ambush throne pulpit or concert platform as occasion required Uncle Edward had preached his first sermon at the age of eight from that old gray boulder; and Aunt Julia whose voice was to delight thousands sang her earliest madrigals there The Story Girl mounted to the ledge sat on the rim and looked at us Pat sat gravely at its base and daintily washed his face with his black paws Now for your stories about the orchard said I There are two important ones said the Story Girl The story of the Poet Who Was Kissed and the Tale of the Family Ghost Which one shall I tell? Tell them both said Felix greedily but tell the ghost one first I dont know The Story Girl looked dubious That sort of story ought to be told in the twilight among the shadows Then it would frighten the souls out of your bodies We thought it might be more agreeable not to have the souls frightened out of our bodies and we voted for the Family Ghost Ghost stories are more comfortable in daytime said Felix The Story Girl began it and we listened avidly Cecily who had heard it many times before listened just as eagerly as we did She declared to me afterwards that no matter how often the Story Girl told a story it always seemed as new and exciting as if you had just heard it for the first time Long long ago began the Story Girl her voice giving us an impression of remote antiquity even before Grandfather King was born an orphan cousin of his lived here with his parents Her name was Emily King She was very small and very sweet She had soft brown eyes that were too timid to look straight at anybody--like Cecilys there--and long sleek brown curls--like mine; and she had a tiny birthmark like a pink butterfly on one cheek--right here Of course there was no orchard here then It was just a field; but there was a clump of white birches in it right where that big spreading tree of Uncle Alecs is now and Emily liked to sit among the ferns under the birches and read or sew She had a lover His name was Malcolm Ward and he was as handsome as a prince She loved him with all her heart and he loved her the same; but they had never spoken about it They used to meet under the birches and talk about everything except love One day he told her he was coming the next day to ask A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION and he wanted to find her under the birches when he came Emily promised to meet him there I am sure she stayed awake that night thinking about it and wondering what the important question would be although she knew perfectly well I would have And the next day she dressed herself beautifully in her best pale blue muslin and sleeked her curls and went smiling to the birches And while she was waiting there thinking such lovely thoughts a neighbours boy came running up--a boy who didnt know about her romance--and cried out that Malcolm Ward had been killed by his gun going off accidentally Emily just put her hands to her heart--so--and fell all white and broken among the ferns And when she came back to life she never cried or lamented She was CHANGED She was never never like herself again; and she was never contented unless she was dressed in her blue muslin and waiting under the birches She got paler and paler every day but the pink butterfly grew redder until it looked just like a stain of blood on her white cheek When the winter came she died But next spring --the Story Girl dropped her voice to a whisper that was as audible and thrilling as her louder tones-- people began to tell that Emily was sometimes seen waiting under the birches still Nobody knew just who told it first But more than one person saw her Grandfather saw her when he was a little boy And my mother saw her once Did YOU ever see her? asked Felix skeptically No but I shall some day if I keep on believing in her said the Story Girl confidently I wouldnt like to see her Id be afraid said Cecily with a shiver There wouldnt be anything to be afraid of said the Story Girl reassuringly Its not as if it were a strange ghost Its our own family ghost so of course it wouldnt hurt us We were not so sure of this Ghosts were unchancy folk even if they were our family ghosts The Story Girl had made the tale very real to us We were glad we had not heard it in the evening How could we ever have got back to the house through the shadows and swaying branches of a darkening orchard? As it was we were almost afraid to look up it lest we should see the waiting blue-clad Emily under Uncle Alecs tree But all we saw was Felicity tearing over the green sward her curls streaming behind her in a golden cloud Felicitys afraid shes missed something remarked the Story Girl in a tone of quiet amusement Is your breakfast ready Felicity or have I time to tell the boys the Story of the Poet Who Was Kissed? Breakfast is ready but we cant have it till father is through attending to the sick cow so you will likely have time answered Felicity Felix and I couldnt keep our eyes off her Crimson-cheeked shining-eyed from her haste her face was like a rose of youth But when the Story Girl spoke we forgot to look at Felicity About ten years after Grandfather and Grandmother King were married a young man came to visit them He was a distant relative of grandmothers and he was a Poet He was just beginning to be famous He was VERY famous afterward He came into the orchard to write a poem and he fell asleep with his head on a bench that used to be under grandfathers tree Then Great-Aunt Edith came into the orchard She was not a Great-Aunt then of course She was only eighteen with red lips and black black hair and eyes They say she was always full of mischief She had been away and had just come home and she didnt know about the Poet But when she saw him sleeping there she thought he was a cousin they had been expecting from Scotland And she tiptoed up--so--and bent over--so--and kissed his cheek Then he opened his big blue eyes and looked up into Ediths face She blushed as red as a rose for she knew she had done a dreadful thing This could not be her cousin from Scotland She knew for he had written so to her that he had eyes as black as her own Edith ran away and hid; and of course she felt still worse when she found out that he was a famous poet But he wrote one of his most beautiful poems on it afterwards and sent it to her--and it was published in one of his books We had SEEN it all--the sleeping genius--the roguish red-lipped girl--the kiss dropped as lightly as a rose-petal on the sunburned cheek They should have got married said Felix Well in a book they would have but you see this was in real life said the Story Girl We sometimes act the story out I like it when Peter plays the poet I dont like it when Dan is the poet because he is so freckled and screws his eyes up so tight But you can hardly ever coax Peter to be the poet--except when Felicity is Edith--and Dan is so obliging that way What is Peter like? I asked Peter is splendid His mother lives on the Markdale road and washes for a living Peters father ran away and left them when Peter was only three years old He has never come back and they dont know whether he is alive or dead Isnt that a nice way to behave to your family? Peter has worked for his board ever since he was six Uncle Roger sends him to school and pays him wages in summer We all like Peter except Felicity I like Peter well enough in his place said Felicity primly but you make far too much of him mother says He is only a hired boy and he hasnt been well brought up and hasnt much education I dont think you should make such an equal of him as you do Laughter rippled over the Story Girls face as shadow waves go over ripe wheat before a wind Peter is a real gentleman and he is more interesting than YOU could ever be if you were brought up and educated for a hundred years she said He can hardly write said Felicity William the Conqueror couldnt write at all said the Story Girl crushingly He never goes to church and he never says his prayers retorted Felicity uncrushed I do too said Peter himself suddenly appearing through a little gap in the hedge I say my prayers sometimes This Peter was a slim shapely fellow with laughing black eyes and thick black curls Early in the season as it was he was barefooted His attire consisted of a faded gingham shirt and a scanty pair of corduroy knickerbockers; but he wore it with such an unconscious air of purple and fine linen that he seemed to be much better dressed than he really was You dont pray very often insisted Felicity Well God will be all the more likely to listen to me if I dont pester Him all the time argued Peter This was rank heresy to Felicity but the Story Girl looked as if she thought there might be something in it You NEVER go to church anyhow continued Felicity determined not to be argued down Well I aint going to church till Ive made up my mind whether Im going to be a Methodist or a Presbyterian Aunt Jane was a Methodist My mother aint much of anything but I mean to be something Its more respectable to be a Methodist or a Presbyterian or SOMETHING than not to be anything When Ive settled what Im to be Im going to church same as you Thats not the same as being BORN something said Felicity loftily I think its a good deal better to pick your own religion than have to take it just because it was what your folks had retorted Peter Now never mind quarrelling said Cecily You leave Peter alone Felicity Peter this is Beverley King and this is Felix And were all going to be good friends and have a lovely summer together Think of the games we can have! But if you go squabbling youll spoil it all Peter what are you going to do to-day? Harrow the wood field and dig your Aunt Olivias flower beds Aunt Olivia and I planted sweet peas yesterday said the Story Girl and I planted a little bed of my own I am NOT going to dig them up this year to see if they have sprouted It is bad for them I shall try to cultivate patience no matter how long they are coming up I am going to help mother plant the vegetable garden to-day said Felicity Oh I never like the vegetable garden said the Story Girl Except when I am hungry Then I DO like to go and look at the nice little rows of onions and beets But I love a flower garden I think I could be always good if I lived in a garden all the time Adam and Eve lived in a garden all the time said Felicity and THEY were far from being always good They mightnt have kept good as long as they did if they hadnt lived in a garden said the Story Girl We were now summoned to breakfast Peter and the Story Girl slipped away through the gap followed by Paddy and the rest of us walked up the orchard to the house Well what do you think of the Story Girl? asked Felicity Shes just fine said Felix enthusiastically I never heard anything like her to tell stories She cant cook said Felicity and she hasnt a good complexion Mind you she says shes going to be an actress when she grows up Isnt that dreadful? We didnt exactly see why Oh because actresses are always wicked people said Felicity in a shocked tone But I daresay the Story Girl will go and be one just as soon as she can Her father will back her up in it He is an artist you know Evidently Felicity thought artists and actresses and all such poor trash were members one of another Aunt Olivia says the Story Girl is fascinating said Cecily The very adjective! Felix and I recognized its beautiful fitness at once Yes the Story Girl WAS fascinating and that was the final word to be said on the subject Dan did not come down until breakfast was half over and Aunt Janet talked to him after a fashion which made us realize that it would be well to keep as the piquant country phrase went from the rough side of her tongue But all things considered we liked the prospect of our summer very much Felicity to look at--the Story Girl to tell us tales of wonder--Cecily to admire us--Dan and Peter to play with--what more could reasonable fellows want? CHAPTER IV THE WEDDING VEIL OF THE PROUD PRINCESS When we had lived for a fortnight in Carlisle we belonged there and the freedom of all its small fry was conferred on us With Peter and Dan with Felicity and Cecily and the Story Girl with pale gray-eyed little Sara Ray we were boon companions We went to school of course; and certain home chores were assigned to each of us for the faithful performance of which we were held responsible But we had long hours for play Even Peter had plenty of spare time when the planting was over We got along very well with each other in the main in spite of some minor differences of opinion As for the grown-up denizens of our small world they suited us also We adored Aunt Olivia; she was pretty and merry and kind; and above all she had mastered to perfection the rare art of letting children alone If we kept ourselves tolerably clean and refrained from quarrelling or talking slang Aunt Olivia did not worry us Aunt Janet on the contrary gave us so much good advice and was so constantly telling us to do this or not to do the other thing that we could not remember half her instructions and did not try Uncle Roger was as we had been informed quite jolly and fond of teasing We liked him; but we had an uncomfortable feeling that the meaning of his remarks was not always that which met the ear Sometimes we believed Uncle Roger was making fun of us and the deadly seriousness of youth in us resented that To Uncle Alec we gave our warmest love We felt that we always had a friend at court in Uncle Alec no matter what we did or left undone And we never had to turn HIS speeches inside out to discover their meaning The social life of juvenile Carlisle centred in the day and Sunday Schools We were especially interested in our Sunday School for we were fortunate enough to be assigned to a teacher who made our lessons so interesting that we no longer regarded Sunday School attendance as a disagreeable weekly duty; but instead looked forward to it with pleasure and tried to carry out our teachers gentle precepts--at least on Mondays and Tuesdays I am afraid the remembrance grew a little dim the rest of the week She was also deeply interested in missions; and one talk on this subject inspired the Story Girl to do a little home missionary work on her own account The only thing she could think of along this line was to persuade Peter to go to church Felicity did not approve of the design and said so plainly He wont know how to behave for hes never been inside a church door in his life she warned the Story Girl Hell likely do something awful and then youll feel ashamed and wish youd never asked him to go and well all be disgraced Its all right to have our mite boxes for the heathen and send missionaries to them Theyre far away and we dont have to associate with them But I dont want to have to sit in a pew with a hired boy But the Story Girl undauntedly continued to coax the reluctant Peter It was not an easy matter Peter did not come of a churchgoing stock; and besides he alleged he had not yet made up his mind whether to be a Presbyterian or a Methodist It isnt a bit of difference which you are pleaded the Story Girl They both go to heaven But one way must be easier or better than the other or else theyd all be one kind argued Peter I want to find the easiest way And Ive got a hankering after the Methodists My Aunt Jane was a Methodist Isnt she one still? asked Felicity pertly Well I dont know exactly Shes dead said Peter rebukingly Do people go on being just the same after theyre dead? No of course not Theyre angels then--not Methodists or anything but just angels That is if they go to heaven Sposen they went to the other place? But Felicitys theology broke down at this point She turned her back on Peter and walked disdainfully away The Story Girl returned to the main point with a new argument We have such a lovely minister Peter He looks just like the picture of St John my father sent me only he is old and his hair is white I know youd like him And even if you are going to be a Methodist it wont hurt you to go to the Presbyterian church The nearest Methodist church is six miles away at Markdale and you cant attend there just now Go to the Presbyterian church until youre old enough to have a horse But sposen I got too fond of being Presbyterian and couldnt change if I wanted to? objected Peter Altogether the Story Girl had a hard time of it; but she persevered; and one day she came to us with the announcement that Peter had yielded Hes going to church with us to-morrow she said triumphantly We were out in Uncle Rogers hill pasture sitting on some smooth round stones under a clump of birches Behind us was an old gray fence with violets and dandelions thick in its corners Below us was the Carlisle valley with its orchard-embowered homesteads and fertile meadows Its upper end was dim with a delicate spring mist Winds blew up the field like wave upon wave of sweet savour--spice of bracken and balsam We were eating little jam turnovers which Felicity had made for us Felicitys turnovers were perfection I looked at her and wondered why it was not enough that she should be so pretty and capable of making such turnovers If she were only more interesting! Felicity had not a particle of the nameless charm and allurement which hung about every motion of the Story Girl and made itself manifest in her lightest word and most careless glance Ah well one cannot have every good gift! The Story Girl had no dimples at her slim brown wrists We all enjoyed our turnovers except Sara Ray She ate hers but she knew she should not have done so Her mother did not approve of snacks between meals or of jam turnovers at any time Once when Sara was in a brown study I asked her what she was thinking of Im trying to think of something ma hasnt forbid she answered with a sigh We were all glad to hear that Peter was going to church except Felicity She was full of gloomy forebodings and warnings Im surprised at you Felicity King said Cecily severely You ought to be glad that poor boy is going to get started in the right way Theres a great big patch on his best pair of trousers protested Felicity Well thats better than a hole said the Story Girl addressing herself daintily to her turnover God wont notice the patch No but the Carlisle people will retorted Felicity in a tone which implied that what the Carlisle people thought was far more important And I dont believe that Peter has got a decent stocking to his name What will you feel like if he goes to church with the skin of his legs showing through the holes Miss Story Girl? Im not a bit afraid said the Story Girl staunchly Peter knows better than that Well all I hope is that hell wash behind his ears said Felicity resignedly How is Pat to-day? asked Cecily by way of changing the conversation Pat isnt a bit better He just mopes about the kitchen said the Story Girl anxiously I went out to the barn and I saw a mouse I had a stick in my hand and I fetched a swipe at it--so I killed it stone dead Then I took it in to Paddy Will you believe it? He wouldnt even look at it Im so worried Uncle Roger says he needs a dose of physic But how is he to be made take it thats the question I mixed a powder in some milk and tried to pour it down his throat while Peter held him Just look at the scratches I got! And the milk went everywhere except down Pats throat Wouldnt it be awful if--if anything happened to Pat? whispered Cecily Well we could have a jolly funeral you know said Dan We looked at him in such horror that Dan hastened to apologize Id be awful sorry myself if Pat died But if he DID wed have to give him the right kind of a funeral he protested Why Paddy just seems like one of the family The Story Girl finished her turnover and stretched herself out on the grasses pillowing her chin in her hands and looking at the sky She was bare headed as usual and her scarlet ribbon was bound filletwise about her head She had twined freshly plucked dandelions around it and the effect was that of a crown of brilliant golden stars on her sleek brown curls Look at that long thin lacy cloud up there she said What does it make you think of girls? A wedding veil said Cecily That is just what it is--the Wedding Veil of the Proud Princess I know a story about it I read it in a book Once upon a time --the Story Girls eyes grew dreamy and her accents floated away on the summer air like wind-blown rose petals-- there was a princess who was the most beautiful princess in the world and kings from all lands came to woo her for a bride But she was as proud as she was beautiful She laughed all her suitors to scorn And when her father urged her to choose one of them as her husband she drew herself up haughtily--so-- The Story Girl sprang to her feet and for a moment we saw the proud princess of the old tale in all her scornful loveliness-- and she said I will not wed until a king comes who can conquer all kings Then I shall be the wife of the king of the world and no one can hold herself higher than I So every king went to war to prove that he could conquer every one else and there was a great deal of bloodshed and misery But the proud princess laughed and sang and she and her maidens worked at a wonderful lace veil which she meant to wear when the king of all kings came It was a very beautiful veil; but her maidens whispered that a man had died and a womans heart had broken for every stitch set in it Just when a king thought he had conquered everybody some other king would come and conquer HIM; and so it went on until it did not seem likely the proud princess would ever get a husband at all But still her pride was so great that she would not yield even though everybody except the kings who wanted to marry her hated her for the suffering she had caused One day a horn was blown at the palace gate; and there was one tall man in complete armor with his visor down riding on a white horse When he said he had come to marry the princess every one laughed for he had no retinue and no beautiful apparel and no golden crown But I am the king who conquers all kings he said You must prove it before I shall marry you said the proud princess But she trembled and turned pale for there was something in his voice that frightened her And when he laughed his laughter was still more dreadful I can easily prove it beautiful princess he said but you must go with me to my kingdom for the proof Marry me now and you and I and your father and all your court will ride straightway to my kingdom; and if you are not satisfied then that I am the king who conquers all kings you may give me back my ring and return home free of me forever more It was a strange wooing and the friends of the princess begged her to refuse But her pride whispered that it would be such a wonderful thing to be the queen of the king of the world; so she consented; and her maidens dressed her and put on the long lace veil that had been so many years a-making Then they were married at once but the bridegroom never lifted his visor and no one saw his face The proud princess held herself more proudly than ever but she was as white as her veil And there was no laughter or merry-making such as should be at a wedding and every one looked at every one else with fear in his eyes After the wedding the bridegroom lifted his bride before him on his white horse and her father and all the members of his court mounted too and rode after them On and on they rode and the skies grew darker and the wind blew and wailed and the shades of evening came down And just in the twilight they rode into a dark valley filled with tombs and graves Why have you brought me here? cried the proud princess angrily This is my kingdom he answered These are the tombs of the kings I have conquered Behold me beautiful princess I am Death! He lifted his visor All saw his awful face The proud princess shrieked Come to my arms my bride he cried I have won you fairly I am the king who conquers all kings! He clasped her fainting form to his breast and spurred his white horse to the tombs A tempest of rain broke over the valley and blotted them from sight Very sadly the old king and courtiers rode home and never never again did human eye behold the proud princess But when those long white clouds sweep across the sky the country people in the land where she lived say Look you there is the Wedding Veil of the Proud Princess The weird spell of the tale rested on us for some moments after the Story Girl had finished We had walked with her in the place of death and grown cold with the horror that chilled the heart of the poor princess Dan presently broke the spell You see it doesnt do to be too proud Felicity he remarked giving her a poke Youd better not say too much about Peters patches CHAPTER V PETER GOES TO CHURCH There was no Sunday School the next afternoon as superintendent and teachers wished to attend a communion service at Markdale The Carlisle service was in the evening and at sunset we were waiting at Uncle Alecs front door for Peter and the Story Girl None of the grown-ups were going to church Aunt Olivia had a sick headache and Uncle Roger stayed home with her Aunt Janet and Uncle Alec had gone to the Markdale service and had not yet returned Felicity and Cecily were wearing their new summer muslins for the first time--and were acutely conscious of the fact Felicity her pink and white face shadowed by her drooping forget-me-not-wreathed leghorn hat was as beautiful as usual; but Cecily having tortured her hair with curl papers all night had a rampant bush of curls all about her head which quite destroyed the sweet nun-like expression of her little features Cecily cherished a grudge against fate because she had not been given naturally curly hair as had the other two girls But she attained the desire of her heart on Sundays at least and was quite well satisfied It was impossible to convince her that the satin smooth lustre of her week-day tresses was much more becoming to her Presently Peter and the Story Girl appeared and we were all more or less relieved to see that Peter looked quite respectable despite the indisputable patch on his trousers His face was rosy his thick black curls were smoothly combed and his tie was neatly bowed; but it was his legs which we scrutinized most anxiously At first glance they seemed well enough; but closer inspection revealed something not altogether customary What is the matter with your stockings Peter? asked Dan bluntly Oh I hadnt a pair without holes in the legs answered Peter easily because ma hadnt time to darn them this week So I put on two pairs The holes dont come in the same places and youd never notice them unless you looked right close Have you got a cent for collection? demanded Felicity Ive got a Yankee cent I spose it will do wont it? Felicity shook her head vehemently Oh no no It may be all right to pass a Yankee cent on a store keeper or an egg peddler but it would never do for church Ill have to go without any then said Peter I havent another cent I only get fifty cents a week and I give it all to ma last night But Peter must have a cent Felicity would have given him one herself--and she was none too lavish of her coppers--rather than have him go without one Dan however lent him one on the distinct understanding that it was to be repaid the next week Uncle Roger wandered by at this moment and beholding Peter said Is Saul also among the prophets? What can have induced you to turn church-goer Peter when all Olivias gentle persuasions were of no avail? The old old argument I suppose--beauty draws us with a single hair Uncle Roger looked quizzically at Felicity We did not know what his quotations meant but we understood he thought Peter was going to church because of Felicity Felicity tossed her head It isnt my fault that hes going to church she said snappishly Its the Story Girls doings Uncle Roger sat down on the doorstep and gave himself over to one of the silent inward paroxysms of laughter we all found so very aggravating He shook his big blond head shut his eyes and murmured Not her fault! Oh Felicity Felicity youll be the death of your dear Uncle yet if you dont watch out Felicity started off indignantly and we followed picking up Sara Ray at the foot of the hill The Carlisle church was a very old-fashioned one with a square ivy-hung tower It was shaded by tall elms and the graveyard surrounded it completely many of the graves being directly under its windows We always took the corner path through it passing the King plot where our kindred of four generations slept in a green solitude of wavering light and shadow There was Great-grandfather Kings flat tombstone of rough Island sandstone so overgrown with ivy that we could hardly read its lengthy inscription recording his whole history in brief and finishing with eight lines of original verse composed by his widow I do not think that poetry was Great-grandmother Kings strong point When Felix read it on our first Sunday in Carlisle he remarked dubiously that it LOOKED like poetry but didnt SOUND like it There too slept the Emily whose faithful spirit was supposed to haunt the orchard; but Edith who had kissed the poet lay not with her kindred She had died in a far foreign land and the murmur of an alien sea sounded about her grave White marble tablets ornamented with weeping willow trees marked where Grandfather and Grandmother King were buried and a single shaft of red Scotch granite stood between the graves of Aunt Felicity and Uncle Felix The Story Girl lingered to lay a bunch of wild violets misty blue and faintly sweet on her mothers grave; and then she read aloud the verse on the stone They were lovely and pleasant in their lives and in their death they were not divided The tones of her voice brought out the poignant and immortal beauty and pathos of that wonderful old lament The girls wiped their eyes; and we boys felt as if we might have done so too had nobody been looking What better epitaph could any one wish than to have it said that he was lovely and pleasant in his life? When I heard the Story Girl read it I made a secret compact with myself that I would try to deserve such an epitaph I wish I had a family plot said Peter rather wistfully I havent ANYTHING you fellows have The Craigs are just buried anywhere they happen to die Id like to be buried here when I die said Felix But I hope it wont be for a good while yet he added in a livelier tone as we moved onward to the church The interior of the church was as old-fashioned as its exterior It was furnished with square box pews; the pulpit was a wine-glass one and was reached by a steep narrow flight of steps Uncle Alecs pew was at the top of the church quite near the pulpit Peters appearance did not attract as much attention as we had fondly expected Indeed nobody seemed to notice him at all The lamps were not yet lighted and the church was filled with a soft twilight and hush Outside the sky was purple and gold and silvery green with a delicate tangle of rosy cloud above the elms Isnt it awful nice and holy in here? whispered Peter reverently I didnt know church was like this Its nice Felicity frowned at him and the Story Girl touched her with her slippered foot to remind him that he must not talk in church Peter stiffened up and sat at attention during the service Nobody could have behaved better But when the sermon was over and the collection was being taken up he made the sensation which his entrance had not produced Elder Frewen a tall pale man with long sandy side-whiskers appeared at the door of our pew with the collection plate We knew Elder Frewen quite well and liked him; he was Aunt Janets cousin and often visited her The contrast between his week-day jollity and the unearthly solemnity of his countenance on Sundays always struck us as very funny It seemed so to strike Peter; for as Peter dropped his cent into the plate he laughed aloud! Everybody looked at our pew I have always wondered why Felicity did not die of mortification on the spot The Story Girl turned white and Cecily turned red As for that poor unlucky Peter the shame of his countenance was pitiful to behold He never lifted his head for the remainder of the service; and he followed us down the aisle and across the graveyard like a beaten dog None of us uttered a word until we reached the road lying in the white moonshine of the May night Then Felicity broke the tense silence by remarking to the Story Girl I told you so! The Story Girl made no response Peter sidled up to her Im awful sorry he said contritely I never meant to laugh It just happened before I could stop myself It was this way-- Dont you ever speak to me again said the Story Girl in a tone of cold concentrated fury Go and be a Methodist or a Mohammedan or ANYTHING! I dont care what you are! You have HUMILIATED me! She marched off with Sara Ray and Peter dropped back to us with a frightened face What is it Ive done to her? he whispered What does that big word mean? Oh never mind I said crossly--for I felt that Peter HAD disgraced us-- Shes just mad--and no wonder Whatever made you act so crazy Peter? Well I didnt mean to And I wanted to laugh twice before that and DIDNT It was the Story Girls stories made me want to laugh so I dont think its fair for her to be mad at me She hadnt ought to tell me stories about people if she dont want me to laugh when I see them When I looked at Samuel Ward I thought of him getting up in meeting one night and praying that he might be guided in his upsetting and downrising I remembered the way she took him off and I wanted to laugh And then I looked at the pulpit and thought of the story she told about the old Scotch minister who was too fat to get in at the door of it and had to hist himself by his two hands over it and then whispered to the other minister so that everybody heard him _This pulpit door was made for speerits_--and I wanted to laugh And then Mr Frewen come--and I thought of her story about his sidewhiskers--how when his first wife died of information of the lungs he went courting Celia Ward and Celia told him she wouldnt marry him unless he shaved them whiskers off And he wouldnt just to be stubborn And one day one of them caught fire when he was burning brush and burned off and every one thought hed HAVE to shave the other off then But he didnt and just went round with one whisker till the burned one grew out And then Celia gave in and took him because she saw there wasnt no hope of HIM ever giving in I just remembered that story and I thought I could see him taking up the cents so solemn with one long whisker; and the laugh just laughed itself before I could help it We all exploded with laughter on the spot much to the horror of Mrs Abraham Ward who was just driving past and who came up the next day and told Aunt Janet we had acted scandalous on the road home from church We felt ashamed ourselves because we knew people should conduct themselves decently and in order on Sunday farings-forth But as with Peter it had laughed itself Even Felicity laughed Felicity was not nearly so angry with Peter as might have been expected She even walked beside him and let him carry her Bible They talked quite confidentially Perhaps she forgave him the more easily because he had justified her in her predictions and thus afforded her a decided triumph over the Story Girl Im going to keep on going to church Peter told her I like it Sermons are more intresting than I thought and I like the singing I wish I could make up my mind whether to be a Presbyterian or a Methodist I spose I might ask the ministers about it Oh no no dont do that said Felicity in alarm Ministers wouldnt want to be bothered with such questions Why not? What are ministers for if they aint to tell people how to get to heaven? Oh well its all right for grown-ups to ask them things of course But it isnt respectful for little boys--especially hired boys I dont see why But anyhow I spose it wouldnt be much use because if he was a Presbyterian minister hed say I ought to be a Presbyterian and if he was a Methodist hed tell me to be one too Look here Felicity what IS the difference between them? I--I dont know said Felicity reluctantly I spose children cant understand such things There must be a great deal of difference of course if we only knew what it was Anyhow I am a Presbyterian and Im glad of it We walked on in silence for a time thinking our own young thoughts Presently they were scattered by an abrupt and startling question from Peter What does God look like? he said It appeared that none of us had any idea The Story Girl would probly know said Cecily I wish I knew said Peter gravely I wish I could see a picture of God It would make Him seem lots more real Ive often wondered myself what he looks like said Felicity in a burst of confidence Even in Felicity so it would seem there were depths of thought unplumbed Ive seen pictures of Jesus said Felix meditatively He looks just like a man only better and kinder But now that I come to think of it Ive never seen a picture of God Well if there isnt one in Toronto it isnt likely theres one anywhere said Peter disappointedly I saw a picture of the devil once he added It was in a book my Aunt Jane had She got it for a prize in school My Aunt Jane was clever It couldnt have been a very good book if there was such a picture in it said Felicity It was a real good book My Aunt Jane wouldnt have a book that wasnt good retorted Peter sulkily He refused to discuss the subject further somewhat to our disappointment For we had never seen a picture of the person referred to and we were rather curious regarding it Well ask Peter to describe it sometime when hes in a better humour whispered Felix Sara Ray having turned in at her own gate I ran ahead to join the Story Girl and we walked up the hill together She had recovered her calmness of mind but she made no reference to Peter When we reached our lane and passed under Grandfather Kings big willow the fragrance of the orchard struck us in the face like a wave We could see the long rows of trees a white gladness in the moonshine It seemed to us that there was in the orchard something different from other orchards that we had known We were too young to analyze the vague sensation In later years we were to understand that it was because the orchard blossomed not only apple blossoms but all the love faith joy pure happiness and pure sorrow of those who had made it and walked there The orchard doesnt seem the same place by moonlight at all said the Story Girl dreamily Its lovely but its different When I was very small I used to believe the fairies danced in it on moonlight nights I would like to believe it now but I cant Why not? Oh its so hard to believe things you know are not true It was Uncle Edward who told me there were no such things as fairies I was just seven He is a minister so of course I knew he spoke the truth It was his duty to tell me and I do not blame him but I have never felt quite the same to Uncle Edward since Ah do we ever feel quite the same towards people who destroy our illusions? Shall I ever be able to forgive the brutal creature who first told me there was no such person as Santa Claus? He was a boy three years older than myself; and he may now for aught I know be a most useful and respectable member of society beloved by his kind But I know what he must ever seem to me! We waited at Uncle Alecs door for the others to come up Peter was by way of skulking shamefacedly past into the shadows; but the Story Girls brief bitter anger had vanished Wait for me Peter she called She went over to him and held out her hand I forgive you she said graciously Felix and I felt that it would really be worth while to offend her just to be forgiven in such an adorable voice Peter eagerly grasped her hand I tell you what Story Girl Im awfully sorry I laughed in church but you neednt be afraid I ever will again No sir! And Im going to church and Sunday School regular and Ill say my prayers every night I want to be like the rest of you And look here! Ive thought of the way my Aunt Jane used to give medicine to a cat You mix the powder in lard and spread it on his paws and his sides and hell lick it off cause a cat cant stand being messy If Paddy isnt any better to-morrow well do that They went away together hand in hand children-wise up the lane of spruces crossed with bars of moonlight And there was peace over all that fresh and flowery land and peace in our little hearts CHAPTER VI THE MYSTERY OF GOLDEN MILESTONE Paddy was smeared with medicated lard the next day all of us assisting at the rite although the Story Girl was high priestess Then out of regard for mats and cushions he was kept in durance vile in the granary until he had licked his fur clean This treatment being repeated every day for a week Pat recovered his usual health and spirits and our minds were set at rest to enjoy the next excitement--collecting for a school library fund Our teacher thought it would be an excellent thing to have a library in connection with the school; and he suggested that each of the pupils should try to see how much money he or she could raise for the project during the month of June We might earn it by honest toil or gather it in by contributions levied on our friends The result was a determined rivalry as to which pupil should collect the largest sum; and this rivalry was especially intense in our home coterie Our relatives started us with a quarter apiece For the rest we knew we must depend on our own exertions Peter was handicapped at the beginning by the fact that he had no family friend to finance him If my Aunt Janed been living shed have given me something he remarked And if my father hadnt run away he might have given me something too But Im going to do the best I can anyhow Your Aunt Olivia says I can have the job of gathering the eggs and Im to have one egg out of every dozen to sell for myself Felicity made a similar bargain with her mother The Story Girl and Cecily were each to be paid ten cents a week for washing dishes in their respective homes Felix and Dan contracted to keep the gardens free from weeds I caught brook trout in the westering valley of spruces and sold them for a cent apiece Sara Ray was the only unhappy one among us She could do nothing She had no relatives in Carlisle except her mother and her mother did not approve of the school library project and would not give Sara a cent or put her in any way of earning one To Sara this was humiliation indescribable She felt herself an outcast and an alien to our busy little circle where each member counted every day with miserly delight his slowly increasing hoard of small cash Im just going to pray to God to send me some money she announced desperately at last I dont believe that will do any good said Dan He gives lots of things but he doesnt give money because people can earn that for themselves I cant said Sara with passionate defiance I think He ought to take that into account Dont worry dear said Cecily who always poured balm If you cant collect any money everybody will know it isnt your fault I wont ever feel like reading a single book in the library if I cant give something to it mourned Sara Dan and the girls and I were sitting in a row on Aunt Olivias garden fence watching Felix weed Felix worked well although he did not like weeding-- fat boys never do Felicity informed him Felix pretended not to hear her but I knew he did because his ears grew red Felixs face never blushed but his ears always gave him away As for Felicity she did not say things like that out of malice prepense It never occurred to her that Felix did not like to be called fat I always feel so sorry for the poor weeds said the Story Girl dreamily It must be very hard to be rooted up They shouldnt grow in the wrong place said Felicity mercilessly When weeds go to heaven I suppose they will be flowers continued the Story Girl You do think such queer things said Felicity A rich man in Toronto has a floral clock in his garden I said It looks just like the face of a clock and there are flowers in it that open at every hour so that you can always tell the time Oh I wish we had one here exclaimed Cecily What would be the use of it? asked the Story Girl a little disdainfully Nobody ever wants to know the time in a garden I slipped away at this point suddenly remembering that it was time to take a dose of magic seed I had bought it from Billy Robinson three days before in school Billy had assured me that it would make me grow fast I was beginning to feel secretly worried because I did not grow I had overheard Aunt Janet say I was going to be short like Uncle Alec Now I loved Uncle Alec but I wanted to be taller than he was So when Billy confided to me under solemn promise of secrecy that he had some magic seed which would make boys grow and would sell me a box of it for ten cents I jumped at the offer Billy was taller than any boy of his age in Carlisle and he assured me it all came from taking magic seed I was a regular runt before I begun he said and look at me now I got it from Peg Bowen Shes a witch you know I wouldnt go near her again for a bushel of magic seed It was an awful experience I havent much left but I guess Ive enough to do me till Im as tall as I want to be You must take a pinch of the seed every three hours walking backward and you must never tell a soul youre taking it or it wont work I wouldnt spare any of it to any one but you I felt deeply grateful to Billy and sorry that I had not liked him better Somehow nobody did like Billy Robinson over and above But I vowed I WOULD like him in future I paid him the ten cents cheerfully and took the magic seed as directed measuring myself carefully every day by a mark on the hall door I could not see any advance in growth yet but then I had been taking it only three days One day the Story Girl had an inspiration Let us go and ask the Awkward Man and Mr Campbell for a contribution to the library fund she said I am sure no one else has asked them because nobody in Carlisle is related to them Let us all go and if they give us anything well divide it equally among us It was a daring proposition for both Mr Campbell and the Awkward Man were regarded as eccentric personages; and Mr Campbell was supposed to detest children But where the Story Girl led we would follow to the death The next day being Saturday we started out in the afternoon We took a short cut to Golden Milestone over a long green dewy land full of placid meadows where sunshine had fallen asleep At first all was not harmonious Felicity was in an ill humour; she had wanted to wear her second best dress but Aunt Janet had decreed that her school clothes were good enough to go traipsing about in the dust Then the Story Girl arrived arrayed not in any second best but in her very best dress and hat which her father had sent her from Paris--a dress of soft crimson silk and a white leghorn hat encircled by flame-red poppies Neither Felicity nor Cecily could have worn it; but it became the Story Girl perfectly In it she was a thing of fire and laughter and glow as if the singular charm of her temperament were visible and tangible in its vivid colouring and silken texture I shouldnt think youd put on your best clothes to go begging for the library in said Felicity cuttingly Aunt Olivia says that when you are going to have an important interview with a man you ought to look your very best said the Story Girl giving her skirt a lustrous swirl and enjoying the effect Aunt Olivia spoils you said Felicity She doesnt either Felicity King! Aunt Olivia is just sweet She kisses me good-night every night and your mother NEVER kisses you My mother doesnt make kisses so common retorted Felicity But she gives us pie for dinner every day So does Aunt Olivia Yes but look at the difference in the size of the pieces! And Aunt Olivia only gives you skim milk My mother gives us cream Aunt Olivias skim milk is as good as your mothers cream cried the Story Girl hotly Oh girls dont fight said Cecily the peacemaker Its such a nice day and well have a nice time if you dont spoil it by fighting Were NOT fighting said Felicity And I like Aunt Olivia But my mother is just as good as Aunt Olivia there now! Of course she is Aunt Janet is splendid agreed the Story Girl They smiled at each other amicably Felicity and the Story Girl were really quite fond of each other under the queer surface friction that commonly resulted from their intercourse You said once you knew a story about the Awkward Man said Felix You might tell it to us All right agreed the Story Girl The only trouble is I dont know the whole story But Ill tell you all I do know I call it The Mystery of the Golden Milestone Oh I dont believe that story is true said Felicity I believe Mrs Griggs was just romancing She DOES romance mother says Yes; but I dont believe she could ever have thought of such a thing as this herself so I believe it must be true said the Story Girl Anyway this is the story boys You know the Awkward Man has lived alone ever since his mother died ten years ago Abel Griggs is his hired man and he and his wife live in a little house down the Awkward Mans lane Mrs Griggs makes his bread for him and she cleans up his house now and then She says he keeps it very neat But till last fall there was one room she never saw It was always locked--the west one looking out over his garden One day last fall the Awkward Man went to Summerside and Mrs Griggs scrubbed his kitchen Then she went over the whole house and she tried the door of the west room Mrs Griggs is a VERY curious woman Uncle Roger says all women have as much curiosity as is good for them but Mrs Griggs has more She expected to find the door locked as usual It was NOT locked She opened it and went in What do you suppose she found? Something like--like Bluebeards chamber? suggested Felix in a scared tone Oh no NO! Nothing like THAT could happen in Prince Edward Island But if there HAD been beautiful wives hanging up by their hair all round the walls I dont believe Mrs Griggs could have been much more astonished The room had never been furnished in his mothers time but now it was ELEGANTLY furnished though Mrs Griggs says SHE doesnt know when or how that furniture was brought there She says she never saw a room like it in a country farmhouse It was like a bed-room and sitting-room combined The floor was covered with a carpet like green velvet There were fine lace curtains at the windows and beautiful pictures on the walls There was a little white bed and a dressing-table a bookcase full of books a stand with a work basket on it and a rocking-chair There was a womans picture above the bookcase Mrs Griggs says she thinks it was a coloured photograph but she didnt know who it was Anyway it was a very pretty girl But the most amazing thing of all was that A WOMANS DRESS was hanging over a chair by the table Mrs Griggs says it NEVER belonged to Jasper Dales mother for she thought it a sin to wear anything but print and drugget; and this dress was of PALE BLUE silk Besides that there was a pair of blue satin slippers on the floor beside it--HIGH-HEELED slippers And on the fly-leaves of the books the name Alice was written Now there never was an Alice in the Dale connection and nobody ever heard of the Awkward Man having a sweetheart There isnt that a lovely mystery? Its a pretty queer yarn said Felix I wonder if it is true--and what it means I intend to find out what it means said the Story Girl I am going to get acquainted with the Awkward Man sometime and then Ill find out his Alice-secret I dont see how youll ever get acquainted with him said Felicity He never goes anywhere except to church He just stays home and reads books when he isnt working Mother says he is a perfect hermit Ill manage it somehow said the Story Girl--and we had no doubt that she would But I must wait until Im a little older for he wouldnt tell the secret of the west room to a little girl And I mustnt wait till Im TOO old for he is frightened of grown-up girls because he thinks they laugh at his awkwardness I know I will like him He has such a nice face even if he is awkward He looks like a man you could tell things to Well Id like a man who could move around without falling over his own feet said Felicity And then the look of him! Uncle Roger says he is long lank lean narrow and contracted Things always sound worse than they are when Uncle Roger says them said the Story Girl Uncle Edward says Jasper Dale is a very clever man and its a great pity he wasnt able to finish his college course He went to college two years you know Then his father died and he stayed home with his mother because she was very delicate I call him a hero I wonder if it is true that he writes poetry Mrs Griggs says it is She says she has seen him writing it in a brown book She said she couldnt get near enough to read it but she knew it was poetry by the shape of it Very likely If that blue silk dress story is true Id believe ANYTHING of him said Felicity We were near Golden Milestone now The house was a big weather-gray structure overgrown with vines and climbing roses Something about the three square windows in the second story gave it an appearance of winking at us in a friendly fashion through its vines--at least so the Story Girl said; and indeed we could see it for ourselves after she had once pointed it out to us We did not get into the house however We met the Awkward man in his yard and he gave us a quarter apiece for our library He did not seem awkward or shy; but then we were only children and his foot was on his native heath He was a tall slender man who did not look his forty years so unwrinkled was his high white forehead so clear and lustrous his large dark-blue eyes so free from silver threads his rather long black hair He had large hands and feet and walked with a slight stoop I am afraid we stared at him rather rudely while the Story Girl talked to him But was not an Awkward Man who was also a hermit and kept blue silk dresses in a locked room and possibly wrote poetry a legitimate object of curiosity? I leave it to you When we got away we compared notes and found that we all liked him--and this although he had said little and had appeared somewhat glad to get rid of us He gave us the money like a gentleman said the Story Girl I felt he didnt grudge it And now for Mr Campbell It was on HIS account I put on my red silk I dont suppose the Awkward Man noticed it at all but Mr Campbell will or Im much mistaken CHAPTER VII HOW BETTY SHERMAN WON A HUSBAND The rest of us did not share the Story Girls enthusiasm regarding our call on Mr Campbell We secretly dreaded it If as was said he detested children who knew what sort of a reception we might meet? Mr Campbell was a rich retired farmer who took life easily He had visited New York and Boston Toronto and Montreal; he had even been as far as the Pacific coast Therefore he was regarded in Carlisle as a much travelled man; and he was known to be well read and intelligent But it was also known that Mr Campbell was not always in a good humour If he liked you there was nothing he would not do for you; if he disliked you--well you were not left in ignorance of it In short we had the impression that Mr Campbell resembled the famous little girl with the curl in the middle of her forehead When he was good he was very very good and when he was bad he was horrid What if this were one of his horrid days? He cant DO anything to us you know said the Story Girl He may be rude but that wont hurt any one but himself Hard words break no bones observed Felicity philosophically But they hurt your feelings I am afraid of Mr Campbell said Cecily candidly Perhaps wed better give up and go home suggested Dan You can go home if you like said the Story Girl scornfully But I am going to see Mr Campbell I know I can manage him But if I have to go alone and he gives me anything Ill keep it all for my own collection mind you That settled it We were not going to let the Story Girl get ahead of us in the manner of collecting Mr Campbells housekeeper ushered us into his parlour and left us Presently Mr Campbell himself was standing in the doorway looking us over We took heart of grace It seemed to be one of his good days for there was a quizzical smile on his broad clean-shaven strongly-featured face Mr Campbell was a tall man with a massive head well thatched with thick black hair gray-streaked He had big black eyes with many wrinkles around them and a thin firm long-lipped mouth We thought him handsome for an old man His gaze wandered over us with uncomplimentary indifference until it fell on the Story Girl leaning back in an arm-chair She looked like a slender red lily in the unstudied grace of her attitude A spark flashed into Mr Campbells black eyes Is this a Sunday School deputation? he inquired rather ironically No We have come to ask a favour of you said the Story Girl The magic of her voice worked its will on Mr Campbell as on all others He came in sat down hooked his thumb into his vest pocket and smiled at her What is it? he asked We are collecting for our school library and we have called to ask you for a contribution she replied Why should I contribute to your school library? demanded Mr Campbell This was a poser for us Why should he indeed? But the Story Girl was quite equal to it Leaning forward and throwing an indescribable witchery into tone and eyes and smile she said Because a lady asks you Mr Campbell chuckled The best of all reasons he said But see here my dear young lady Im an old miser and curmudgeon as you may have heard I HATE to part with my money even for a good reason And I NEVER part with any of it unless I am to receive some benefit from the expenditure Now what earthly good could I get from your three by six school library? None whatever But I shall make you a fair offer I have heard from my housekeepers urchin of a son that you are a master hand to tell stories Tell me one here and now I shall pay you in proportion to the entertainment you afford me Come now and do your prettiest There was a fine mockery in his tone that put the Story Girl on her mettle instantly She sprang to her feet an amazing change coming over her Her eyes flashed and burned; crimson spots glowed in her cheeks I shall tell you the story of the Sherman girls and how Betty Sherman won a husband she said We gasped Was the Story Girl crazy? Or had she forgotten that Betty Sherman was Mr Campbells own great-grandmother and that her method of winning a husband was not exactly in accordance with maidenly traditions But Mr Campbell chuckled again An excellent test he said If you can amuse ME with that story you must be a wonder Ive heard it so often that it has no more interest for me than the alphabet One cold winter day eighty years ago began the Story Girl without further parley Donald Fraser was sitting by the window of his new house playing his fiddle for company and looking out over the white frozen bay before his door It was bitter bitter cold and a storm was brewing But storm or no storm Donald meant to go over the bay that evening to see Nancy Sherman He was thinking of her as he played Annie Laurie for Nancy was more beautiful than the lady of the song Her face it is the fairest that eer the sun shone on hummed Donald--and oh he thought so too! He did not know whether Nancy cared for him or not He had many rivals But he knew that if she would not come to be the mistress of his new house no one else ever should So he sat there that afternoon and dreamed of her as he played sweet old songs and rollicking jigs on his fiddle While he was playing a sleigh drove up to the door and Neil Campbell came in Donald was not overly glad to see him for he suspected where he was going Neil Campbell who was Highland Scotch and lived down at Berwick was courting Nancy Sherman too; and what was far worse Nancys father favoured him because he was a richer man than Donald Fraser But Donald was not going to show all he thought--Scotch people never do--and he pretended to be very glad to see Neil and made him heartily welcome Neil sat down by the roaring fire looking quite well satisfied with himself It was ten miles from Berwick to the bay shore and a call at a half way house was just the thing Then Donald brought out the whisky They always did that eighty years ago you know If you were a woman you could give your visitors a dish of tea; but if you were a man and did not offer them a taste of whisky you were thought either very mean or very ignorant You look cold said Donald in his great hearty voice Sit nearer the fire man and put a bit of warmth in your veins Its bitter cold the day And now tell me the Berwick news Has Jean McLean made up with her man yet? And is it true that Sandy McQuarrie is to marry Kate Ferguson? Twill be a match now! Sure with her red hair Sandy will not be like to lose his bride past finding Neil had plenty of news to tell And the more whisky he drank the more he told He didnt notice that Donald was not taking much Neil talked on and on and of course he soon began to tell things it would have been much wiser not to tell Finally he told Donald that he was going over the bay to ask Nancy Sherman that very night to marry him And if she would have him then Donald and all the folks should see a wedding that WAS a wedding Oh wasnt Donald taken aback! This was more than he had expected Neil hadnt been courting Nancy very long and Donald never dreamed he would propose to her QUITE so soon At first Donald didnt know what to do He felt sure deep down in his heart that Nancy liked HIM She was very shy and modest but you know a girl can let a man see she likes him without going out of her way But Donald knew that if Neil proposed first he would have the best chance Neil was rich and the Shermans were poor and old Elias Sherman would have the most to say in the matter If he told Nancy she must take Neil Campbell she would never dream of disobeying him Old Elias Sherman was a man who had to be obeyed But if Nancy had only promised some one else first her father would not make her break her word Wasnt it a hard plight for poor Donald? But he was a Scotchman you know and its pretty hard to stick a Scotchman long Presently a twinkle came into his eyes for he remembered that all was fair in love and war So he said to Neil oh so persuasively Have some more man have some more Twill keep the heart in you in the teeth of that wind Help yourself Theres plenty more where that came from Neil didnt want MUCH persuasion He took some more and said slyly Is it going over the bay the night that yourself will be doing? Donald shook his head I had thought of it he owned but it looks a wee like a storm and my sleigh is at the blacksmiths to be shod If I went it must be on Black Dans back and he likes a canter over the ice in a snow-storm as little as I His own fireside is the best place for a man to-night Campbell Have another taste man have another taste Neil went on tasting and that sly Donald sat there with a sober face but laughing eyes and coaxed him on At last Neils head fell forward on his breast and he was sound asleep Donald got up put on his overcoat and cap and went to the door May your sleep be long and sweet man he said laughing softly and as for the waking twill be betwixt you and me With that he untied Neils horse climbed into Neils sleigh and tucked Neils buffalo robe about him Now Bess old girl do your bonniest he said Theres more than you know hangs on your speed If the Campbell wakes too soon Black Dan could show you a pair of clean heels for all your good start On my girl Brown Bess went over the ice like a deer and Donald kept thinking of what he should say to Nancy--and more still of what she would say to him SUPPOSE he was mistaken SUPPOSE she said no! Neil would have the laugh on me then Sure hes sleeping well And the snow is coming soon Therell be a bonny swirl on the bay ere long I hope no harm will come to the lad if he starts to cross When he wakes hell be in such a fine Highland temper that hell never stop to think of danger Well Bess old girl here we are Now Donald Fraser pluck up heart and play the man Never flinch because a slip of a lass looks scornful at you out of the bonniest dark-blue eyes on earth But in spite of his bold words Donalds heart was thumping as he drove into the Sherman yard Nancy was there milking a cow by the stable door but she stood up when she saw Donald coming Oh she was very beautiful! Her hair was like a skein of golden silk and her eyes were as blue as the gulf water when the sun breaks out after a storm Donald felt more nervous than ever But he knew he must make the most of his chance He might not see Nancy alone again before Neil came He caught her hand and stammered out Nan lass I love you You may think tis a hasty wooing but thats a story I can tell you later maybe I know well Im not worthy of you but if true love could make a man worthy thered be none before me Will you have me Nan? Nancy didnt SAY she would have him She just LOOKED it and Donald kissed her right there in the snow The next morning the storm was over Donald knew Neil must be soon on his track He did not want to make the Sherman house the scene of a quarrel so he resolved to get away before the Campbell came He persuaded Nancy to go with him to visit some friends in another settlement As he brought Neils sleigh up to the door he saw a black speck far out on the bay and laughed Black Dan goes well but hell not be quick enough he said Half an hour later Neil Campbell rushed into the Sherman kitchen and oh how angry he was! There was nobody there but Betty Sherman and Betty was not afraid of him She was never afraid of anybody She was very handsome with hair as brown as October nuts and black eyes and crimson cheeks; and she had always been in love with Neil Campbell herself Good morning Mr Campbell she said with a toss of her head Its early abroad you are And on Black Dan no less! Was I mistaken in thinking that Donald Fraser said once that his favourite horse should never be backed by any man but him? But doubtless a fair exchange is no robbery and Brown Bess is a good mare in her way Where is Donald Fraser? said Neil shaking his fist Its him Im seeking and its him I will be finding Where is he Betty Sherman? Donald Fraser is far enough away by this time mocked Betty He is a prudent fellow and has some quickness of wit under that sandy thatch of his He came here last night at sunset with a horse and sleigh not his own or lately gotten and he asked Nan in the stable yard to marry him Did a man ask ME to marry him at the cows side with a milking pail in my hand its a cold answer hed get for his pains But Nan thought differently and they sat late together last night and twas a bonny story Nan wakened me to hear when she came to bed--the story of a braw lover who let his secret out when the whisky was above the wit and then fell asleep while his rival was away to woo and win his lass Did you ever hear a like story Mr Campbell? Oh yes said Neil fiercely It is laughing at me over the country side and telling that story that Donald Fraser will be doing is it? But when I meet him it is not laughing he will be doing Oh no There will be another story to tell! Now dont meddle with the man cried Betty What a state to be in because one good-looking lass likes sandy hair and gray eyes better than Highland black and blue! You have not the spirit of a wren Neil Campbell Were I you I would show Donald Fraser that I could woo and win a lass as speedily as any Lowlander of them all; that I would! Theres many a girl would gladly say yes for your asking And here stands one! Why not marry ME Neil Campbell? Folks say Im as bonny as Nan--and I could love you as well as Nan loves her Donald--ay and ten times better! What do you suppose the Campbell did? Why just the thing he ought to have done He took Betty at her word on the spot; and there was a double wedding soon after And it is said that Neil and Betty were the happiest couple in the world--happier even than Donald and Nancy So all was well because it ended well! The Story Girl curtsied until her silken skirts swept the floor Then she flung herself in her chair and looked at Mr Campbell flushed triumphant daring The story was old to us It had once been published in a Charlottetown paper and we had read in Aunt Olivias scrapbook where the Story Girl had learned it But we had listened entranced I have written down the bare words of the story as she told it; but I can never reproduce the charm and colour and spirit she infused into it It LIVED for us Donald and Neil Nancy and Betty were there in that room with us We saw the flashes of expression on their faces we heard their voices angry or tender mocking or merry in Lowland and Highland accent We realized all the mingled coquetry and feeling and defiance and archness in Betty Shermans daring speech We had even forgotten all about Mr Campbell That gentleman in silence took out his wallet extracted a note therefrom and handed it gravely to the Story Girl There are five dollars for you he said and your story was well worth it You ARE a wonder Some day you will make the world realize it Ive been about a bit and heard some good things but Ive never enjoyed anything more than that threadbare old story I heard in my cradle And now will you do me a favour? Of course said the delighted Story Girl Recite the multiplication table for me said Mr Campbell We stared Well might Mr Campbell be called eccentric What on earth did he want the multiplication table recited for? Even the Story Girl was surprised But she began promptly with twice one and went through it to twelve times twelve She repeated it simply but her voice changed from one tone to another as each in succession grew tired We had never dreamed that there was so much in the multiplication table As she announced it the fact that three times three was nine was exquisitely ridiculous five times six almost brought tears to our eyes eight times seven was the most tragic and frightful thing ever heard of and twelve times twelve rang like a trumpet call to victory Mr Campbell nodded his satisfaction I thought you could do it he said The other day I found this statement in a book Her voice would have made the multiplication table charming! I thought of it when I heard yours I didnt believe it before but I do now Then he let us go You see said the Story Girl as we went home you need never be afraid of people But we are not all Story Girls said Cecily That night we heard Felicity talking to Cecily in their room Mr Campbell never noticed one of us except the Story Girl she said but if I had put on MY best dress as she did maybe she wouldnt have taken all the attention Could you ever do what Betty Sherman did do you suppose? asked Cecily absently No; but I believe the Story Girl could answered Felicity rather snappishly CHAPTER VIII A TRAGEDY OF CHILDHOOD The Story Girl went to Charlottetown for a week in June to visit Aunt Louisa Life seemed very colourless without her and even Felicity admitted that it was lonesome But three days after her departure Felix told us something on the way home from school which lent some spice to existence immediately What do you think? he said in a very solemn yet excited tone Jerry Cowan told me at recess this afternoon that he HAD SEEN A PICTURE OF GOD--that he has it at home in an old red-covered history of the world and has looked at it OFTEN To think that Jerry Cowan should have seen such a picture often! We were as deeply impressed as Felix had meant us to be Did he say what it was like? asked Peter No--only that it was a picture of God walking in the garden of Eden Oh whispered Felicity--we all spoke in low tones on the subject for by instinct and training we thought and uttered the Great Name with reverence in spite of our devouring curiosity-- oh WOULD Jerry Cowan bring it to school and let us see it? I asked him that soon as ever he told me said Felix He said he might but he couldnt promise for hed have to ask his mother if he could bring the book to school If shell let him hell bring it to-morrow Oh Ill be almost afraid to look at it said Sara Ray tremulously I think we all shared her fear to some extent Nevertheless we went to school the next day burning with curiosity And we were disappointed Possibly night had brought counsel to Jerry Cowan; or perhaps his mother had put him up to it At all events he announced to us that he couldnt bring the red-covered history to school but if we wanted to buy the picture outright he would tear it out of the book and sell it to us for fifty cents We talked the matter over in serious conclave in the orchard that evening We were all rather short of hard cash having devoted most of our spare means to the school library fund But the general consensus of opinion was that we must have the picture no matter what pecuniary sacrifices were involved If we could each give about seven cents we would have the amount Peter could only give four but Dan gave eleven which squared matters Fifty cents would be pretty dear for any other picture but of course this is different said Dan And theres a picture of Eden thrown in too you know added Felicity Fancy selling Gods picture said Cecily in a shocked awed tone Nobody but a Cowan would do it and thats a fact said Dan When we get it well keep it in the family Bible said Felicity Thats the only proper place Oh I wonder what it will be like breathed Cecily We all wondered Next day in school we agreed to Jerry Cowans terms and Jerry promised to bring the picture up to Uncle Alecs the following afternoon We were all intensely excited Saturday morning To our dismay it began to rain just before dinner What if Jerry doesnt bring the picture to-day because of the rain? I suggested Never you fear answered Felicity decidedly A Cowan would come through ANYTHING for fifty cents After dinner we all without any verbal decision about it washed our faces and combed our hair The girls put on their second best dresses and we boys donned white collars We all had the unuttered feeling that we must do such honour to that Picture as we could Felicity and Dan began a small spat over something but stopped at once when Cecily said severely How DARE you quarrel when you are going to look at a picture of God to-day? Owing to the rain we could not foregather in the orchard where we had meant to transact the business with Jerry We did not wish our grown-ups around at our great moment so we betook ourselves to the loft of the granary in the spruce wood from whose window we could see the main road and hail Jerry Sara Ray had joined us very pale and nervous having had so it appeared a difference of opinion with her mother about coming up the hill in the rain Im afraid I did very wrong to come against mas will she said miserably but I COULDNT wait I wanted to see the picture as soon as you did We waited and watched at the window The valley was full of mist and the rain was coming down in slanting lines over the tops of the spruces But as we waited the clouds broke away and the sun came out flashingly; the drops on the spruce boughs glittered like diamonds I dont believe Jerry can be coming said Cecily in despair I suppose his mother must have thought it was dreadful after all to sell such a picture There he is now! cried Dan waving excitedly from the window Hes carrying a fish-basket said Felicity You surely dont suppose he would bring THAT picture in a fish-basket! Jerry HAD brought it in a fish-basket as appeared when he mounted the granary stairs shortly afterwards It was folded up in a newspaper packet on top of the dried herring with which the basket was filled We paid him his money but we would not open the packet until he had gone Cecily said Felicity in a hushed tone You are the best of us all YOU open the parcel Oh Im no gooder than the rest of you breathed Cecily but Ill open it if you like With trembling fingers Cecily opened the parcel We stood around hardly breathing She unfolded it and held it up We saw it Suddenly Sara began to cry Oh oh oh does God look like THAT? she wailed Felix and I spoke not Disappointment and something worse sealed our speech DID God look like that--like that stern angrily frowning old man with the tossing hair and beard of the wood-cut Cecily held I suppose He must since that is His picture said Dan miserably He looks awful cross said Peter simply Oh I wish wed never never seen it cried Cecily We all wished that--too late Our curiosity had led us into some Holy of Holies not to be profaned by human eyes and this was our punishment Ive always had a feeling right along wept Sara that it wasnt RIGHT to buy--or LOOK AT--Gods picture As we stood there wretchedly we heard flying feet below and a blithe voice calling Where are you children? The Story Girl had returned! At any other moment we would have rushed to meet her in wild joy But now we were too crushed and miserable to move Whatever is the matter with you all? demanded the Story Girl appearing at the top of the stairs What is Sara crying about? What have you got there? A picture of God said Cecily with a sob in her voice and oh it is so dreadful and ugly Look! The Story Girl looked An expression of scorn came over her face Surely you dont believe God looks like that she said impatiently while her fine eyes flashed He doesnt--He couldnt He is wonderful and beautiful Im surprised at you THAT is nothing but the picture of a cross old man Hope sprang up in our hearts although we were not wholly convinced I dont know said Dan dubiously It says under the picture God in the Garden of Eden Its PRINTED Well I suppose thats what the man who drew it thought God was like answered the Story Girl carelessly But HE couldnt have known any more than you do HE had never seen Him Its all very well for you to say so said Felicity but YOU dont know either I wish I could believe that isnt like God--but I dont know what to believe Well if you wont believe me I suppose youll believe the minister said the Story Girl Go and ask him Hes in the house this very minute He came up with us in the buggy At any other time we would never have dared catechize the minister about anything But desperate cases call for desperate measures We drew straws to see who should go and do the asking and the lot fell to Felix Better wait until Mr Marwood leaves and catch him in the lane advised the Story Girl Youll have a lot of grown-ups around you in the house Felix took her advice Mr Marwood presently walking benignantly along the lane was confronted by a fat small boy with a pale face but resolute eyes The rest of us remained in the background but within hearing Well Felix what is it? asked Mr Marwood kindly Please sir does God really look like this? asked Felix holding out the picture We hope He doesnt--but we want to know the truth and that is why Im bothering you Please excuse us and tell me The minister looked at the picture A stern expression came into his gentle blue eyes and he got as near to frowning as it was possible for him to get Where did you get that thing? he asked THING! We began to breathe easier We bought it from Jerry Cowan He found it in a red-covered history of the world It SAYS its Gods picture said Felix It is nothing of the sort said Mr Marwood indignantly There is no such thing as a picture of God Felix No human being knows what he looks like--no human being CAN know We should not even try to think what He looks like But Felix you may be sure that God is infinitely more beautiful and loving and tender and kind than anything we can imagine of Him Never believe anything else my boy As for this--this SACRILEGE--take it and burn it We did not know what a sacrilege meant but we knew that Mr Marwood had declared that the picture was not like God That was enough for us We felt as if a terrible weight had been lifted from our minds I could hardly believe the Story Girl but of course the minister KNOWS said Dan happily Weve lost fifty cents because of it said Felicity gloomily We had lost something of infinitely more value than fifty cents although we did not realize it just then The ministers words had removed from our minds the bitter belief that God was like that picture; but on something deeper and more enduring than mind an impression had been made that was never to be removed The mischief was done From that day to this the thought or the mention of God brings up before us involuntarily the vision of a stern angry old man Such was the price we were to pay for the indulgence of a curiosity which each of us deep in our hearts had like Sara Ray felt ought not to be gratified Mr Marwood told me to burn it said Felix It doesnt seem reverent to do that said Cecily Even if it isnt Gods picture it has His name on it Bury it said the Story Girl We did bury it after tea in the depths of the spruce grove; and then we went into the orchard It was so nice to have the Story Girl back again She had wreathed her hair with Canterbury Bells and looked like the incarnation of rhyme and story and dream Canterbury Bells is a lovely name for a flower isnt it? she said It makes you think of cathedrals and chimes doesnt it? Lets go over to Uncle Stephens Walk and sit on the branches of the big tree Its too wet on the grass and I know a story--a TRUE story about an old lady I saw in town at Aunt Louisas Such a dear old lady with lovely silvery curls After the rain the air seemed dripping with odours in the warm west wind--the tang of fir balsam the spice of mint the wild woodsiness of ferns the aroma of grasses steeping in the sunshine--and with it all a breath of wild sweetness from far hill pastures Scattered through the grass in Uncle Stephens Walk were blossoming pale aerial flowers which had no name that we could ever discover Nobody seemed to know anything about them They had been there when Great-grandfather King bought the place I have never seen them elsewhere or found them described in any floral catalogue We called them the White Ladies The Story Girl gave them the name She said they looked like the souls of good women who had had to suffer much and had been very patient They were wonderfully dainty with a strange faint aromatic perfume which was only to be detected at a little distance and vanished if you bent over them They faded soon after they were plucked; and although strangers greatly admiring them often carried away roots and seeds they could never be coaxed to grow elsewhere My story is about Mrs Dunbar and the Captain of the FANNY said the Story Girl settling herself comfortably on a bough with her brown head against a gnarled trunk Its sad and beautiful--and true I do love to tell stories that I know really happened Mrs Dunbar lives next door to Aunt Louisa in town She is so sweet You wouldnt think to look at her that she had a tragedy in her life but she has Aunt Louisa told me the tale It all happened long long ago Interesting things like this all did happen long ago it seems to me They never seem to happen now This was in 49 when people were rushing to the gold fields in California It was just like a fever Aunt Louisa says People took it right here on the Island; and a number of young men determined they would go to California It is easy to go to California now; but it was a very different matter then There were no railroads across the land as there are now and if you wanted to go to California you had to go in a sailing vessel all the way around Cape Horn It was a long and dangerous journey; and sometimes it took over six months When you got there you had no way of sending word home again except by the same plan It might be over a year before your people at home heard a word about you--and fancy what their feelings would be! But these young men didnt think of these things; they were led on by a golden vision They made all their arrangements and they chartered the brig _Fanny_ to take them to California The captain of the _Fanny_ is the hero of my story His name was Alan Dunbar and he was young and handsome Heroes always are you know but Aunt Louisa says he really was And he was in love--wildly in love--with Margaret Grant Margaret was as beautiful as a dream with soft blue eyes and clouds of golden hair; and she loved Alan Dunbar just as much as he loved her But her parents were bitterly opposed to him and they had forbidden Margaret to see him or speak to him They hadnt anything against him as a MAN but they didnt want her to throw herself away on a sailor Well when Alan Dunbar knew that he must go to California in the _Fanny_ he was in despair He felt that he could NEVER go so far away for so long and leave his Margaret behind And Margaret felt that she could never let him go I know EXACTLY how she felt How can you know? interrupted Peter suddenly You aint old enough to have a beau How can you know? The Story Girl looked at Peter with a frown She did not like to be interrupted when telling a story Those are not things one KNOWS about she said with dignity One FEELS about them Peter crushed but not convinced subsided and the Story Girl went on Finally Margaret ran away with Alan and they were married in Charlottetown Alan intended to take his wife with him to California in the _Fanny_ If it was a hard journey for a man it was harder still for a woman but Margaret would have dared anything for Alans sake They had three days--ONLY three days--of happiness and then the blow fell The crew and the passengers of the _Fanny_ refused to let Captain Dunbar take his wife with him They told him he must leave her behind And all his prayers were of no avail They say he stood on the deck of the _Fanny_ and pleaded with the men while the tears ran down his face; but they would not yield and he had to leave Margaret behind Oh what a parting it was! There was heartbreak in the Story Girls voice and tears came into our eyes There in the green bower of Uncle Stephens Walk we cried over the pathos of a parting whose anguish had been stilled for many years When it was all over Margarets father and mother forgave her and she went back home to wait--to WAIT Oh it is so dreadful just to WAIT and do nothing else Margaret waited for nearly a year How long it must have seemed to her! And at last there came a letter--but not from Alan Alan was DEAD He had died in California and had been buried there While Margaret had been thinking of him and longing for him and praying for him he had been lying in his lonely faraway grave Cecily sprang up shaking with sobs Oh dont--dont go on she implored I CANT bear any more There is no more said the Story Girl That was the end of it--the end of everything for Margaret It didnt kill HER but her heart died I just wish Id hold of those fellows who wouldnt let the Captain take his wife said Peter savagely Well it was awful said said Felicity wiping her eyes But it was long ago and we cant do any good by crying over it now Let us go and get something to eat I made some nice little rhubarb tarts this morning We went In spite of new disappointments and old heartbreaks we had appetites And Felicity did make scrumptious rhubarb tarts! CHAPTER IX MAGIC SEED When the time came to hand in our collections for the library fund Peter had the largest--three dollars Felicity was a good second with two and a half This was simply because the hens had laid so well If youd had to pay father for all the extra handfuls of wheat youve fed to those hens Miss Felicity you wouldnt have so much said Dan spitefully I didnt said Felicity indignantly Look how Aunt Olivias hens laid too and she fed them herself just the same as usual Never mind said Cecily we have all got something to give If you were like poor Sara Ray and hadnt been able to collect anything you might feel bad But Sara Ray HAD something to give She came up the hill after tea all radiant When Sara Ray smiled--and she did not waste her smiles--she was rather pretty in a plaintive apologetic way A dimple or two came into sight and she had very nice teeth--small and white like the traditional row of pearls Oh just look she said Here are three dollars--and Im going to give it all to the library fund I had a letter to-day from Uncle Arthur in Winnipeg and he sent me three dollars He said I was to use it ANY way I liked so ma couldnt refuse to let me give it to the fund She thinks its an awful waste but she always goes by what Uncle Arthur says Oh Ive prayed so hard that some money might come some way and now it has See what praying does! I was very much afraid that we did not rejoice quite as unselfishly in Saras good fortune as we should have done WE had earned our contributions by the sweat of our brow or by the scarcely less disagreeable method of begging And Saras had as good as descended upon her out of the skies as much like a miracle as anything you could imagine She prayed for it you know said Felix after Sara had gone home Thats too easy a way of earning money grumbled Peter resentfully If the rest of us had just set down and done nothing only prayed how much do you spose wed have? It dont seem fair to me Oh well its different with Sara said Dan We COULD earn money and she COULDNT You see? But come on down to the orchard The Story Girl had a letter from her father to-day and shes going to read it to us We went promptly A letter from the Story Girls father was always an event; and to hear her read it was almost as good as hearing her tell a story Before coming to Carlisle Uncle Blair Stanley had been a mere name to us Now he was a personality His letters to the Story Girl the pictures and sketches he sent her her adoring and frequent mention of him all combined to make him very real to us We FELT then what we did not understand till later years that our grown-up relatives did not altogether admire or approve of Uncle Blair He belonged to a different world from theirs They had never known him very intimately or understood him I realize now that Uncle Blair was a bit of a Bohemian--a respectable sort of tramp Had he been a poor man he might have been a more successful artist But he had a small fortune of his own and lacking the spur of necessity or of disquieting ambition he remained little more than a clever amateur Once in a while he painted a picture which showed what he could do; but for the rest he was satisfied to wander over the world light-hearted and content We knew that the Story Girl was thought to resemble him strongly in appearance and temperament but she had far more fire and intensity and strength of will--her inheritance from King and Ward She would never be satisfied as a dabbler; whatever her future career should be into it she would throw all her powers of mind and heart and soul But Uncle Blair could do at least one thing surpassingly well He could write letters Such letters! By contrast Felix and I were secretly ashamed of fathers epistles Father could talk well but as Felix said he couldnt write worth a cent The letters we had received from him since his arrival in Rio de Janeiro were mere scrawls telling us to be good boys and not trouble Aunt Janet incidentally adding that he was well and lonesome Felix and I were always glad to get his letters but we never read them aloud to an admiring circle in the orchard Uncle Blair was spending the summer in Switzerland; and the letter the Story Girl read to us among the fair frail White Ladies of the Walk where the west wind came now with a sigh and again with a rush and then brushed our faces as softly as the down of a thistle was full of the glamour of mountain-rimmed lakes and purple chalets and snowy summits old in story We climbed Mount Blanc saw the Jungfrau soaring into cloudland and walked among the gloomy pillars of Bonnivards prison Finally the Story Girl told us the tale of the Prisoner of Chillon in words that were Byrons but in a voice that was all her own It must be splendid to go to Europe sighed Cecily longingly I am going some day said the Story Girl airily We looked at her with a slightly incredulous awe To us in those years Europe seemed almost as remote and unreachable as the moon It was hard to believe that one of US should ever go there But Aunt Julia had gone--and SHE had been brought up in Carlisle on this very farm So it was possible that the Story Girl might go too What will you do there? asked Peter practically I shall learn how to tell stories to all the world said the Story Girl dreamily It was a lovely golden-brown evening; the orchard and the farm-lands beyond were full of ruby lights and kissing shadows Over in the east above the Awkward Mans house the Wedding Veil of the Proud Princess floated across the sky presently turning as rosy as if bedewed with her hearts blood We sat there and talked until the first star lighted a white taper over the beech hill Then I remembered that I had forgotten to take my dose of magic seed and I hastened to do it although I was beginning to lose faith in it I had not grown a single bit by the merciless testimony of the hall door I took the box of seed out of my trunk in the twilit room and swallowed the decreed pinch As I did so Dans voice rang out behind me Beverley King what have you got there? I thrust the box hastily into my trunk and confronted Dan None of your business I said defiantly Yes tis Dan was too much in earnest to resent my blunt speech Look here Bev is that magic seed? And did you get it from Billy Robinson? Dan and I looked at each other suspicion dawning in our eyes What do you know about Billy Robinson and his magic seed? I demanded Just this I bought a box from him for--for--something He said he wasnt going to sell any of it to anybody else Did he sell any to you? Yes he did I said in disgust--for I was beginning to understand that Billy and his magic seed were arrant frauds What for? YOUR mouth is a decent size said Dan Mouth? It had nothing to do with my mouth! He said it would make me grow tall And it hasnt--not an inch! I dont see what you wanted it for! You are tall enough I got it for my mouth said Dan with a shame-faced grin The girls in school laugh at it so Kate Marr says its like a gash in a pie Billy said that seed would shrink it for sure Well there it was! Billy had deceived us both Nor were we the only victims We did not find the whole story out at once Indeed the summer was almost over before in one way or another the full measure of that shameless Billy Robinsons iniquity was revealed to us But I shall anticipate the successive relations in this chapter Every pupil of Carlisle school so it eventually appeared had bought magic seed under solemn promise of secrecy Felix had believed blissfully that it would make him thin Cecilys hair was to become naturally curly and Sara Ray was not to be afraid of Peg Bowen any more It was to make Felicity as clever as the Story Girl and it was to make the Story Girl as good a cook as Felicity What Peter had bought magic seed for remained a secret longer than any of the others Finally--it was the night before what we expected would be the Judgment Day--he confessed to me that he had taken it to make Felicity fond of him Skilfully indeed had that astute Billy played on our respective weaknesses The keenest edge to our humiliation was given by the discovery that the magic seed was nothing more or less than caraway which grew in abundance at Billy Robinsons uncles in Markdale Peg Bowen had had nothing to do with it Well we had all been badly hoaxed But we did not trumpet our wrongs abroad We did not even call Billy to account We thought that least said was soonest mended in such a matter We went very softly indeed lest the grown-ups especially that terrible Uncle Roger should hear of it We should have known better than to trust Billy Robinson said Felicity summing up the case one evening when all had been made known After all what could you expect from a pig but a grunt? We were not surprised to find that Billy Robinsons contribution to the library fund was the largest handed in by any of the scholars Cecily said she didnt envy him his conscience But I am afraid she measured his conscience by her own I doubt very much if Billys troubled him at all CHAPTER X A DAUGHTER OF EVE I hate the thought of growing up said the Story Girl reflectively because I can never go barefooted then and nobody will ever see what beautiful feet I have She was sitting the July sunlight on the ledge of the open hayloft window in Uncle Rogers big barn; and the bare feet below her print skirt WERE beautiful They were slender and shapely and satin smooth with arched insteps the daintiest of toes and nails like pink shells We were all in the hayloft The Story Girl had been telling us a tale Of old unhappy far-off things And battles long ago Felicity and Cecily were curled up in a corner and we boys sprawled idly on the fragrant sun-warm heaps We had stowed the hay in the loft that morning for Uncle Roger so we felt that we had earned the right to loll on our sweet-smelling couch Haylofts are delicious places with just enough of shadow and soft uncertain noises to give an agreeable tang of mystery The swallows flew in and out of their nest above our heads and whenever a sunbeam fell through a chink the air swarmed with golden dust Outside of the loft was a vast sunshiny gulf of blue sky and mellow air wherein floated argosies of fluffy cloud and airy tops of maple and spruce Pat was with us of course prowling about stealthily or making frantic bootless leaps at the swallows A cat in a hayloft is a beautiful example of the eternal fitness of things We had not heard of this fitness then but we all felt that Paddy was in his own place in a hayloft I think it is very vain to talk about anything you have yourself being beautiful said Felicity I am not a bit vain said the Story Girl with entire truthfulness It is not vanity to know your own good points It would just be stupidity if you didnt Its only vanity when you get puffed up about them I am not a bit pretty My only good points are my hair and eyes and feet So I think its real mean that one of them has to be covered up the most of the time Im always glad when it gets warm enough to go barefooted But when I grow up theyll have to covered all the time It IS mean Youll have to put your shoes and stockings on when you go to the magic lantern show to-night said Felicity in a tone of satisfaction I dont know that Im thinking of going barefooted Oh you wouldnt! Sara Stanley youre not in earnest! exclaimed Felicity her blue eyes filling with horror The Story Girl winked with the side of her face next to Felix and me but the side next the girls changed not a muscle She dearly loved to take a rise out of Felicity now and then Indeed I would if I just made up my mind to Why not? Why not bare feet--if theyre clean--as well as bare hands and face? Oh you wouldnt! It would be such a disgrace! said poor Felicity in real distress We went to school barefooted all June argued that wicked Story Girl What is the difference between going to the schoolhouse barefooted in the daytime and going in the evening? Oh theres EVERY difference I cant just explain it--but every one KNOWS there is a difference You know it yourself Oh PLEASE dont do such a thing Sara Well I wont just to oblige you said the Story Girl who would have died the death before she would have gone to a public meeting barefooted We were all rather excited over the magic lantern show which an itinerant lecturer was to give in the schoolhouse that evening Even Felix and I who had seen such shows galore were interested and the rest were quite wild There had never been such a thing in Carlisle before We were all going Peter included Peter went everywhere with us now He was a regular attendant at church and Sunday School where his behaviour was as irreproachable as if he had been raised in the caste of Vere de Vere It was a feather in the Story Girls cap for she took all the credit of having started Peter on the right road Felicity was resigned although the fatal patch on Peters best trousers was still an eyesore to her She declared she never got any good of the singing because Peter stood up then and every one could see the patch Mrs James Clark whose pew was behind ours never took her eye off it--or so Felicity averred But Peters stockings were always darned Aunt Olivia had seen to that ever since she heard of Peters singular device regarding them on his first Sunday She had also given Peter a Bible of which he was so proud that he hated to use it lest he should soil it I think Ill wrap it up and keep it in my box he said Ive an old Bible of Aunt Janes at home that I can use I spose its just the same even if it is old isnt it? Oh yes Cecily had assured him The Bible is always the same I thought maybe theyd got some new improvements on it since Aunt Janes day said Peter relieved Sara Ray is coming along the lane and shes crying announced Dan who was peering out of a knot-hole on the opposite side of the loft Sara Ray is crying half her time said Cecily impatiently Im sure she cries a quartful of tears a month There are times when you cant help crying But I hide then Sara just goes and cries in public The lachrymose Sara presently joined us and we discovered the cause of her tears to be the doleful fact that her mother had forbidden her to go to the magic lantern show that night We all showed the sympathy we felt She SAID yesterday you could go said the Story Girl indignantly Why has she changed her mind? Because of the measles in Markdale sobbed Sara She says Markdale is full of them and therell be sure to be some of the Markdale people at the show So Im not to go And Ive never seen a magic lantern--Ive never seen ANYTHING I dont believe theres any danger of catching measles said Felicity If there was we wouldnt be allowed to go I wish I COULD get the measles said Sara defiantly Maybe Id be of some importance to ma then Suppose Cecily goes down with you and coaxes your mother suggested the Story Girl Perhaps shed let you go then She likes Cecily She doesnt like either Felicity or me so it would only make matters worse for us to try Mas gone to town--pa and her went this afternoon--and theyre not coming back till to-morrow Theres nobody home but Judy Pineau and me Then said the Story Girl why dont you just go to the show anyhow? Your mother wont ever know if you coax Judy to hold her tongue Oh but thats wrong said Felicity You shouldnt put Sara up to disobeying her mother Now Felicity for once was undoubtedly right The Story Girls suggestion WAS wrong; and if it had been Cecily who protested the Story Girl would probably have listened to her and proceeded no further in the matter But Felicity was one of those unfortunate people whose protests against wrong-doing serve only to drive the wrong-doer further on her sinful way The Story Girl resented Felicitys superior tone and proceeded to tempt Sara in right good earnest The rest of us held our tongues It was we told ourselves Saras own lookout I have a good mind to do it said Sara but I cant get my good clothes; theyre in the spare room and ma locked the door for fear somebody would get at the fruit cake I havent a single thing to wear except my school gingham Well thats new and pretty said the Story Girl Well lend you some things You can have my lace collar Thatll make the gingham quite elegant And Cecily will lend you her second best hat But Ive no shoes or stockings Theyre locked up too You can have a pair of mine said Felicity who probably thought that since Sara was certain to yield to temptation she might as well be garbed decently for her transgression Sara did yield When the Story Girls voice entreated it was not easy to resist its temptation even if you wanted to That evening when we started for the schoolhouse Sara Ray was among us decked out in borrowed plumes Suppose she DOES catch the measles? Felicity said aside I dont believe therell be anybody there from Markdale The lecturer is going to Markdale next week Theyll wait for that said the Story Girl airily It was a cool dewy evening and we walked down the long red hill in the highest of spirits Over a valley filled with beech and spruce was a sunset afterglow--creamy yellow and a hue that was not so much red as the dream of red with a young moon swung low in it The air was sweet with the breath of mown hayfields where swaths of clover had been steeping in the sun Wild roses grew pinkly along the fences and the roadsides were star-dusted with buttercups Those of us who had nothing the matter with our consciences enjoyed our walk to the little whitewashed schoolhouse in the valley Felicity and Cecily were void of offence towards all men The Story Girl walked uprightly like an incarnate flame in her crimson silk Her pretty feet were hidden in the tan-coloured buttoned Paris boots which were the secret envy of every school girl in Carlisle But Sara Ray was not happy Her face was so melancholy that the Story Girl lost patience with her The Story Girl herself was not altogether at ease Probably her own conscience was troubling her But admit it she would not Now Sara she said you just take my advice and go into this with all your heart if you go at all Never mind if it is bad Theres no use being naughty if you spoil your fun by wishing all the time you were good You can repent afterwards but there is no use in mixing the two things together Im not repenting protested Sara Im only scared of ma finding it out Oh! The Story Girls voice expressed her scorn For remorse she had understanding and sympathy; but fear of her fellow creatures was something unknown to her Didnt Judy Pineau promise you solemnly she wouldnt tell? Yes; but maybe some one who sees me there will mention it to ma Well if youre so scared youd better not go It isnt too late Heres your own gate said Cecily But Sara could not give up the delights of the show So she walked on a small miserable testimony that the way of the transgressor is never easy even when said transgressor is only a damsel of eleven The magic lantern show was a splendid one The views were good and the lecturer witty We repeated his jokes to each other all the way home Sara who had not enjoyed the exhibition at all seemed to feel more cheerful when it was over and she was going home The Story Girl on the contrary was gloomy There WERE Markdale people there she confided to me and the Williamsons live next door to the Cowans who have measles I wish Id never egged Sara on to going--but dont tell Felicity I said so If Sara Ray had really enjoyed the show I wouldnt mind But she didnt I could see that So Ive done wrong and made her do wrong--and theres nothing to show for it The night was scented and mysterious The wind was playing an eerie fleshless melody in the reeds of the brook hollow The sky was dark and starry and across it the Milky Way flung its shimmering misty ribbons Theres four hundred million stars in the Milky Way quoth Peter who frequently astonished us by knowing more than any hired boy could be expected to He had a retentive memory and never forgot anything he heard or read The few books left to him by his oft-referred-to Aunt Jane had stocked his mind with a miscellaneous information which sometimes made Felix and me doubt if we knew as much as Peter after all Felicity was so impressed by his knowledge of astronomy that she dropped back from the other girls and walked beside him She had not done so before because he was barefooted It was permissible for hired boys to go to public meetings--when not held in the church--with bare feet and no particular disgrace attached to it But Felicity would not walk with a barefooted companion It was dark now so nobody would notice his feet I know a story about the Milky Way said the Story Girl brightening up I read it in a book of Aunt Louisas in town and I learned it off by heart Once there were two archangels in heaven named Zerah and Zulamith-- Have angels names--same as people? interrupted Peter Yes of course They MUST have Theyd be all mixed up if they hadnt And when Im an angel--if I ever get to be one--will my name still be Peter? No Youll have a new name up there said Cecily gently It says so in the Bible Well Im glad of that Peter would be such a funny name for an angel And what is the difference between angels and archangels? Oh archangels are angels that have been angels so long that theyve had time to grow better and brighter and more beautiful than newer angels said the Story Girl who probably made that explanation up on the spur of the moment just to pacify Peter How long does it take for an angel to grow into an archangel? pursued Peter Oh I dont know Millions of years likely And even then I dont suppose ALL the angels do A good many of them must just stay plain angels I expect I shall be satisfied just to be a plain angel said Felicity modestly Oh see here if youre going to interrupt and argue over everything well never get the story told said Felix Dry up all of you and let the Story Girl go on We dried up and the Story Girl went on Zerah and Zulamith loved each other just as mortals love and this is forbidden by the laws of the Almighty And because Zerah and Zulamith had so broken Gods law they were banished from His presence to the uttermost bounds of the universe If they had been banished TOGETHER it would have been no punishment; so Zerah was exiled to a star on one side of the universe and Zulamith was sent to a star on the other side of the universe; and between them was a fathomless abyss which thought itself could not cross Only one thing could cross it--and that was love Zulamith yearned for Zerah with such fidelity and longing that he began to build up a bridge of light from his star; and Zerah not knowing this but loving and longing for him began to build a similar bridge of light from her star For a thousand thousand years they both built the bridge of light and at last they met and sprang into each others arms Their toil and loneliness and suffering were all over and forgotten and the bridge they had built spanned the gulf between their stars of exile Now when the other archangels saw what had been done they flew in fear and anger to Gods white throne and cried to Him See what these rebellious ones have done! They have built them a bridge of light across the universe and set Thy decree of separation at naught Do Thou then stretch forth Thine arm and destroy their impious work They ceased--and all heaven was hushed Through the silence sounded the voice of the Almighty Nay He said whatsoever in my universe true love hath builded not even the Almighty can destroy The bridge must stand forever And concluded the Story Girl her face upturned to the sky and her big eyes filled with starlight it stands still That bridge is the Milky Way What a lovely story sighed Sara Ray who had been wooed to a temporary forgetfulness of her woes by its charm The rest of us came back to earth feeling that we had been wandering among the hosts of heaven We were not old enough to appreciate fully the wonderful meaning of the legend; but we felt its beauty and its appeal To us forevermore the Milky Way would be not Peters overwhelming garland of suns but the lucent bridge love-created on which the banished archangels crossed from star to star We had to go up Sara Rays lane with her to her very door for she was afraid Peg Bowen would catch her if she went alone Then the Story Girl and I walked up the hill together Peter and Felicity lagged behind Cecily and Dan and Felix were walking before us hand in hand singing a hymn Cecily had a very sweet voice and I listened in delight But the Story Girl sighed What if Sara does take the measles? she asked miserably Everyone has to have the measles sometime I said comfortingly and the younger you are the better CHAPTER XI THE STORY GIRL DOES PENANCE Ten days later Aunt Olivia and Uncle Roger went to town one evening to remain over night and the next day Peter and the Story Girl were to stay at Uncle Alecs during their absence We were in the orchard at sunset listening to the story of King Cophetua and the beggar maid--all of us except Peter who was hoeing turnips and Felicity who had gone down the hill on an errand to Mrs Ray The Story Girl impersonated the beggar maid so vividly and with such an illusion of beauty that we did not wonder in the least at the kings love for her I had read the story before and it had been my opinion that it was rot No king I felt certain would ever marry a beggar maid when he had princesses galore from whom to choose But now I understood it all When Felicity returned we concluded from her expression that she had news And she had Sara is real sick she said with regret and something that was not regret mingled in her voice She has a cold and sore throat and she is feverish Mrs Ray says if she isnt better by the morning shes going to send for the doctor AND SHE IS AFRAID ITS THE MEASLES Felicity flung the last sentence at the Story Girl who turned very pale Oh do you suppose she caught them at the magic lantern show? she said miserably Where else could she have caught them? said Felicity mercilessly I didnt see her of course--Mrs Ray met me at the door and told me not to come in But Mrs Ray says the measles always go awful hard with the Rays--if they dont die completely of them it leaves them deaf or half blind or something like that Of course added Felicity her heart melting at sight of the misery in the Story Girls piteous eyes Mrs Ray always looks on the dark side and it may not be the measles Sara has after all But Felicity had done her work too thoroughly The Story Girl was not to be comforted Id give anything if Id never put Sara up to going to that show she said Its all my fault--but the punishment falls on Sara and that isnt fair Id go this minute and confess the whole thing to Mrs Ray; but if I did it might get Sara into more trouble and I mustnt do that I shant sleep a wink to-night I dont think she did She looked very pale and woebegone when she came down to breakfast But for all that there was a certain exhilaration about her Im going to do penance all day for coaxing Sara to disobey her mother she announced with chastened triumph Penance? we murmured in bewilderment Yes Im going to deny myself everything I like and do everything I can think of that I dont like just to punish myself for being so wicked And if any of you think of anything I dont just mention it to me I thought it out last night Maybe Sara wont be so very sick if God sees Im truly sorry He can see it anyhow without your doing anything said Cecily Well my conscience will feel better I dont believe Presbyterians ever do penance said Felicity dubiously I never heard of one doing it But the rest of us rather looked with favour on the Story Girls idea We felt sure that she would do penance as picturesquely and thoroughly as she did everything else You might put peas in your shoes you know suggested Peter The very thing! I never thought of that Ill get some after breakfast Im not going to eat a single thing all day except bread and water--and not much of that! This we felt was a heroic measure indeed To sit down to one of Aunt Janets meals in ordinary health and appetite and eat nothing but bread and water--that would be penance with a vengeance! We felt WE could never do it But the Story Girl did it We admired and pitied her But now I do not think that she either needed our pity or deserved our admiration Her ascetic fare was really sweeter to her than honey of Hymettus She was though quite unconsciously acting a part and tasting all the subtle joy of the artist which is so much more exquisite than any material pleasure Aunt Janet of course noticed the Story Girls abstinence and asked if she was sick No I am just doing penance Aunt Janet for a sin I committed I cant confess it because that would bring trouble on another person So Im going to do penance all day You dont mind do you? Aunt Janet was in a very good humour that morning so she merely laughed Not if you dont go too far with your nonsense she said tolerantly Thank you And will you give me a handful of hard peas after breakfast Aunt Janet? I want to put them in my shoes There isnt any; I used the last in the soup yesterday Oh! The Story Girl was much disappointed Then I suppose Ill have to do without The new peas wouldnt hurt enough Theyre so soft theyd just squash flat Ill tell you said Peter Ill pick up a lot of those little round pebbles on Mr Kings front walk Theyll be just as good as peas Youll do nothing of the sort said Aunt Janet Sara must not do penance in that way She would wear holes in her stockings and might seriously bruise her feet What would you say if I took a whip and whipped my bare shoulders till the blood came? demanded the Story Girl aggrieved I wouldnt SAY anything retorted Aunt Janet Id simply turn you over my knee and give you a sound solid spanking Miss Sara Youd find that penance enough The Story Girl was crimson with indignation To have such a remark made to you--when you were fourteen and a half--and before the boys too! Really Aunt Janet could be very dreadful It was vacation and there was not much to do that day; we were soon free to seek the orchard But the Story Girl would not come She had seated herself in the darkest hottest corner of the kitchen with a piece of old cotton in her hand I am not going to play to-day she said and Im not going to tell a single story Aunt Janet wont let me put pebbles in my shoes but Ive put a thistle next my skin on my back and it sticks into me if I lean back the least bit And Im going to work buttonholes all over this cotton I hate working buttonholes worse than anything in the world so Im going to work them all day Whats the good of working buttonholes on an old rag? asked Felicity It isnt any good The beauty of penance is that it makes you feel uncomfortable So it doesnt matter what you do whether its useful or not so long as its nasty Oh I wonder how Sara is this morning Mothers going down this afternoon said Felicity She says none of us must go near the place till we know whether it is the measles or not Ive thought of a great penance said Cecily eagerly Dont go to the missionary meeting to-night The Story Girl looked piteous I thought of that myself--but I CANT stay home Cecily It would be more than flesh and blood could endure I MUST hear that missionary speak They say he was all but eaten by cannibals once Just think how many new stories Id have to tell after Id heard him! No I must go but Ill tell you what Ill do Ill wear my school dress and hat THAT will be penance Felicity when you set the table for dinner put the broken-handled knife for me I hate it so And Im going to take a dose of Mexican Tea every two hours Its such dreadful tasting stuff--but its a good blood purifier so Aunt Janet cant object to it The Story Girl carried out her self-imposed penance fully All day she sat in the kitchen and worked buttonholes subsisting on bread and water and Mexican Tea Felicity did a mean thing She went to work and made little raisin pies right there in the kitchen before the Story Girl The smell of raisin pies is something to tempt an anchorite; and the Story Girl was exceedingly fond of them Felicity ate two in her very presence and then brought the rest out to us in the orchard The Story Girl could see us through the window carousing without stint on raisin pies and Uncle Edwards cherries But she worked on at her buttonholes She would not look at the exciting serial in the new magazine Dan brought home from the post-office neither would she open a letter from her father Pat came over but his most seductive purrs won no notice from his mistress who refused herself the pleasure of even patting him Aunt Janet could not go down the hill in the afternoon to find out how Sara was because company came to tea--the Millwards from Markdale Mr Millward was a doctor and Mrs Millward was a BA Aunt Janet was very desirous that everything should be as nice as possible and we were all sent to our rooms before tea to wash and dress up The Story Girl slipped over home and when she came back we gasped She had combed her hair out straight and braided it in a tight kinky pudgy braid; and she wore an old dress of faded print with holes in the elbows and ragged flounces which was much too short for her Sara Stanley have you taken leave of your senses? demanded Aunt Janet What do you mean by putting on such a rig! Dont you know I have company to tea? Yes and that is just why I put it on Aunt Janet I want to mortify the flesh-- Ill mortify you if I catch you showing yourself to the Millwards like that my girl! Go right home and dress yourself decently--or eat your supper in the kitchen The Story Girl chose the latter alternative She was highly indignant I verily believe that to sit at the dining-room table in that shabby outgrown dress conscious of looking her ugliest and eating only bread and water before the critical Millwards would have been positive bliss to her When we went to the missionary meeting that evening the Story Girl wore her school dress and hat while Felicity and Cecily were in their pretty muslins And she had tied her hair with a snuff-brown ribbon which was very unbecoming to her The first person we saw in the church porch was Mrs Ray She told us that Sara had nothing worse than a feverish cold The missionary had at least seven happy listeners that night We were all glad that Sara did not have measles and the Story Girl was radiant Now you see all your penance was wasted said Felicity as we walked home keeping close together because of the rumour that Peg Bowen was abroad Oh I dont know I feel better since I punished myself But Im going to make up for it to-morrow said the Story Girl energetically In fact Ill begin to-night Im going to the pantry as soon as I get home and Ill read fathers letter before I go to bed Wasnt the missionary splendid? That cannibal story was simply grand I tried to remember every word so that I can tell it just as he told it Missionaries are such noble people Id like to be a missionary and have adventures like that said Felix It would be all right if you could be sure the cannibals would be interrupted in the nick of time as his were said Dan But sposen they werent? Nothing would prevent cannibals from eating Felix if they once caught him giggled Felicity Hes so nice and fat I am sure Felix felt very unlike a missionary at that precise moment Im going to put two cents more a week in my missionary box than Ive been doing said Cecily determinedly Two cents more a week out of Cecilys egg money meant something of a sacrifice It inspired the rest of us We all decided to increase our weekly contribution by a cent or so And Peter who had had no missionary box at all up to this time determined to start one I dont seem to be able to feel as intrested in missionaries as you folks do he said but maybe if I begin to give something Ill get intrested Ill want to know how my moneys being spent I wont be able to give much When your fathers run away and your mother goes out washing and youre only old enough to get fifty cents a week you cant give much to the heathen But Ill do the best I can My Aunt Jane was fond of missions Are there any Methodist heathen? I spose I ought to give my box to them rather than to Presbyterian heathen No its only after theyre converted that theyre anything in particular said Felicity Before that theyre just plain heathen But if you want your money to go to a Methodist missionary you can give it to the Methodist minister at Markdale I guess the Presbyterians can get along without it and look after their own heathen Just smell Mrs Sampsons flowers said Cecily as we passed a trim white paling close to the road over which blew odours sweeter than the perfume of Arabys shore Her roses are all out and that bed of Sweet William is a sight by daylight Sweet William is a dreadful name for a flower said the Story Girl William is a mans name and men are NEVER sweet They are a great many nice things but they are NOT sweet and shouldnt be That is for women Oh look at the moonshine on the road in that gap between the spruces! Id like a dress of moonshine with stars for buttons It wouldnt do said Felicity decidedly You could see through it Which seemed to settle the question of moonshine dresses effectually CHAPTER XII THE BLUE CHEST OF RACHEL WARD Its utterly out of the question said Aunt Janet seriously When Aunt Janet said seriously that anything was out of the question it meant that she was thinking about it and would probably end up by doing it If a thing really was out of the question she merely laughed and refused to discuss it at all The particular matter in or out of the question that opening day of August was a project which Uncle Edward had recently mooted Uncle Edwards youngest daughter was to be married; and Uncle Edward had written over urging Uncle Alec Aunt Janet and Aunt Olivia to go down to Halifax for the wedding and spend a week there Uncle Alec and Aunt Olivia were eager to go; but Aunt Janet at first declared it was impossible How could we go away and leave the place to the mercy of all those young ones? she demanded Wed come home and find them all sick and the house burned down Not a bit of fear of it scoffed Uncle Roger Felicity is as good a housekeeper as you are; and I shall be here to look after them all and keep them from burning the house down Youve been promising Edward for years to visit him and youll never have a better chance The haying is over and harvest isnt on and Alec needs a change He isnt looking well at all I think it was Uncle Rogers last argument which convinced Aunt Janet In the end she decided to go Uncle Rogers house was to be closed and he and Peter and the Story Girl were to take up their abode with us We were all delighted Felicity in especial seemed to be in seventh heaven To be left in sole charge of a big house with three meals a day to plan and prepare with poultry and cows and dairy and garden to superintend apparently furnished forth Felicitys conception of Paradise Of course we were all to help; but Felicity was to run things and she gloried in it The Story Girl was pleased too Felicity is going to give me cooking lessons she confided to me as we walked in the orchard Isnt that fine? It will be easier when there are no grown-ups around to make me nervous and laugh if I make mistakes Uncle Alec and aunts left on Monday morning Poor Aunt Janet was full of dismal forebodings and gave us so many charges and warnings that we did not try to remember any of them; Uncle Alec merely told us to be good and mind what Uncle Roger said Aunt Olivia laughed at us out of her pansy-blue eyes and told us she knew exactly what we felt like and hoped wed have a gorgeous time Mind they go to bed at a decent hour Aunt Janet called back to Uncle Roger as she drove out of the gate And if anything dreadful happens telegraph us Then they were really gone and we were all left to keep house Uncle Roger and Peter went away to their work Felicity at once set the preparations for dinner a-going and allotted to each of us his portion of service The Story Girl was to prepare the potatoes; Felix and Dan were to pick and shell the peas; Cecily was to attend the fire; I was to peel the turnips Felicity made our mouths water by announcing that she was going to make a roly-poly jam pudding for dinner I peeled my turnips on the back porch put them in their pot and set them on the stove Then I was at liberty to watch the others who had longer jobs The kitchen was a scene of happy activity The Story Girl peeled her potatoes somewhat slowly and awkwardly--for she was not deft at household tasks; Dan and Felix shelled peas and tormented Pat by attaching pods to his ears and tail; Felicity flushed and serious measured and stirred skilfully I am sitting on a tragedy said the Story Girl suddenly Felix and I stared We were not quite sure what a tragedy was but we did not think it was an old blue wooden chest such as the Story Girl was undoubtedly sitting on if eyesight counted for anything The old chest filled up the corner between the table and the wall Neither Felix nor I had ever thought about it particularly It was very large and heavy and Felicity generally said hard things of it when she swept the kitchen This old blue chest holds a tragedy explained the Story Girl I know a story about it Cousin Rachel Wards wedding things are all in that old chest said Felicity Who was Cousin Rachel Ward? And why were her wedding things shut up in an old blue chest in Uncle Alecs kitchen? We demanded the tale instantly The Story Girl told it to us as she peeled her potatoes Perhaps the potatoes suffered--Felicity declared the eyes were not properly done at all--but the story did not It is a sad story said the Story Girl and it happened fifty years ago when Grandfather and Grandmother King were quite young Grandmothers cousin Rachel Ward came to spend a winter with them She belonged to Montreal and she was an orphan too just like the Family Ghost I have never heard what she looked like but she MUST have been beautiful of course Mother says she was awful sentimental and romantic interjected Felicity Well anyway she met Will Montague that winter He was handsome--everybody says so -- And an awful flirt said Felicity Felicity I WISH you wouldnt interrupt It spoils the effect What would you feel like if I went and kept stirring things that didnt belong to it into that pudding? I feel just the same way Well Will Montague fell in love with Rachel Ward and she with him and it was all arranged that they were to be married from here in the spring Poor Rachel was so happy that winter; she made all her wedding things with her own hands Girls did then you know for there was no such thing as a sewing-machine Well at last in April the wedding day came and all the guests were here and Rachel was dressed in her wedding robes waiting for her bridegroom And --the Story Girl laid down her knife and potato and clasped her wet hands-- WILL MONTAGUE NEVER CAME! We felt as much of a shock as if we had been one of the expectant guests ourselves What happened to him? Was HE killed too? asked Felix The Story Girl sighed and resumed her work No indeed I wish he had been THAT would have been suitable and romantic No it was just something horrid He had to run away for debt! Fancy! He acted mean right through Aunt Janet says He never sent even a word to Rachel and she never heard from him again Pig! said Felix forcibly She was broken-hearted of course When she found out what had happened she took all her wedding things and her supply of linen and some presents that had been given her and packed them all away in this old blue chest Then she went away back to Montreal and took the key with her She never came back to the Island again--I suppose she couldnt bear to And she has lived in Montreal ever since and never married She is an old woman now--nearly seventy-five And this chest has never been opened since Mother wrote to Cousin Rachel ten years ago said Cecily and asked her if she might open the chest to see if the moths had got into it Theres a crack in the back as big as your finger Cousin Rachel wrote back that if it wasnt for one thing that was in the trunk she would ask mother to open the chest and dispose of the things as she liked But she could not bear that any one but herself should see or touch that one thing So she wanted it left as it was Ma said she washed her hands of it moths or no moths She said if Cousin Rachel had to move that chest every time the floor had to be scrubbed it would cure her of her sentimental nonsense But I think concluded Cecily that I would feel just like Cousin Rachel in her place What was the thing she couldnt bear any one to see? I asked Ma thinks it was her wedding dress But father says he believes it was Will Montagues picture said Felicity He saw her put it in Father knows some of the things that are in the chest He was ten years old and he saw her pack it Theres a white muslin wedding dress and a veil--and--and--a--a --Felicity dropped her eyes and blushed painfully A petticoat embroidered by hand from hem to belt said the Story Girl calmly And a china fruit basket with an apple on the handle went on Felicity much relieved And a tea set and a blue candle-stick Id dearly love to see all the things that are in it said the Story Girl Pa says it must never be opened without Cousin Rachels permission said Cecily Felix and I looked at the chest reverently It had taken on a new significance in our eyes and seemed like a tomb wherein lay buried some dead romance of the vanished years What happened to Will Montague? I asked Nothing! said the Story Girl viciously He just went on living and flourishing He patched up matters with his creditors after awhile and came back to the Island; and in the end he married a real nice girl with money and was very happy Did you ever HEAR of anything so unjust? Beverley King suddenly cried Felicity who had been peering into a pot YOUVE GONE AND PUT THE TURNIPS ON TO BOIL WHOLE JUST LIKE POTATOES! Wasnt that right? I cried in an agony of shame Right! but Felicity had already whisked the turnips out and was slicing them while all the others were laughing at me I had added a tradition on my own account to the family archives Uncle Roger roared when he heard it; and he roared again at night over Peters account of Felix attempting to milk a cow Felix had previously acquired the knack of extracting milk from the udder But he had never before tried to milk a whole cow He did not get on well; the cow tramped on his foot and finally upset the bucket What are you to do when a cow wont stand straight? spluttered Felix angrily Thats the question said Uncle Roger shaking his head gravely Uncle Rogers laughter was hard to bear but his gravity was harder Meanwhile in the pantry the Story Girl apron-enshrouded was being initiated into the mysteries of bread-making Under Felicitys eyes she set the bread and on the morrow she was to bake it The first thing you must do in the morning is knead it well said Felicity and the earlier its done the better--because its such a warm night With that we went to bed and slept as soundly as if tragedies of blue chests and turnips and crooked cows had no place in the scheme of things at all CHAPTER XIII AN OLD PROVERB WITH A NEW MEANING It was half-past five when we boys got up the next morning We were joined on the stairs by Felicity yawning and rosy Oh dear me I overslept myself Uncle Roger wanted breakfast at six Well I suppose the fire is on anyhow for the Story Girl is up I guess she got up early to knead the bread She couldnt sleep all night for worrying over it The fire was on and a flushed and triumphant Story Girl was taking a loaf of bread from the oven Just look she said proudly I have every bit of the bread baked I got up at three and it was lovely and light so I just gave it a right good kneading and popped it into the oven And its all done and out of the way But the loaves dont seem quite as big as they should be she added doubtfully Sara Stanley! Felicity flew across the kitchen Do you mean that you put the bread right into the oven after you kneaded it without leaving it to rise a second time? The Story Girl turned quite pale Yes I did she faltered Oh Felicity wasnt it right? Youve ruined the bread said Felicity flatly Its as heavy as a stone I declare Sara Stanley Id rather have a little common sense than be a great story teller Bitter indeed was the poor Story Girls mortification Dont tell Uncle Roger she implored humbly Oh I wont tell him promised Felicity amiably Its lucky theres enough old bread to do to-day This will go to the hens But its an awful waste of good flour The Story Girl crept out with Felix and me to the morning orchard while Dan and Peter went to do the barn work It isnt ANY use for me to try to learn to cook she said Never mind I said consolingly You can tell splendid stories But what good would that do a hungry boy? wailed the Story Girl Boys aint ALWAYS hungry said Felix gravely Theres times when they aint I dont believe it said the Story Girl drearily Besides added Felix in the tone of one who says while there is life there is yet hope you may learn to cook yet if you keep on trying But Aunt Olivia wont let me waste the stuff My only hope was to learn this week But I suppose Felicity is so disgusted with me now that she wont give me any more lessons I dont care said Felix I like you better than Felicity even if you cant cook Theres lots of folks can make bread But there isnt many who can tell a story like you But its better to be useful than just interesting sighed the Story Girl bitterly And Felicity who was useful would in her secret soul have given anything to be interesting Which is the way of human nature Company descended on us that afternoon First came Aunt Janets sister Mrs Patterson with a daughter of sixteen years and a son of two They were followed by a buggy-load of Markdale people; and finally Mrs Elder Frewen and her sister from Vancouver with two small daughters of the latter arrived It never rains but it pours said Uncle Roger as he went out to take their horse But Felicitys foot was on her native heath She had been baking all the afternoon and with a pantry well stocked with biscuits cookies cakes and pies she cared not if all Carlisle came to tea Cecily set the table and the Story Girl waited on it and washed all the dishes afterwards But all the blushing honours fell to Felicity who received so many compliments that her airs were quite unbearable for the rest of the week She presided at the head of the table with as much grace and dignity as if she had been five times twelve years old and seemed to know by instinct just who took sugar and who took it not She was flushed with excitement and pleasure and was so pretty that I could hardly eat for looking at her--which is the highest compliment in a boys power to pay The Story Girl on the contrary was under eclipse She was pale and lustreless from her disturbed night and early rising; and no opportunity offered to tell a melting tale Nobody took any notice of her It was Felicitys day After tea Mrs Frewen and her sister wished to visit their fathers grave in the Carlisle churchyard It appeared that everybody wanted to go with them; but it was evident that somebody must stay home with Jimmy Patterson who had just fallen sound asleep on the kitchen sofa Dan finally volunteered to look after him He had a new Henty book which he wanted to finish and that he said was better fun than a walk to the graveyard I think well be back before he wakes said Mrs Patterson and anyhow he is very good and wont be any trouble Dont let him go outside though He has a cold now We went away leaving Dan sitting on the door-sill reading his book and Jimmy P snoozing blissfully on the sofa When we returned--Felix and the girls and I were ahead of the others--Dan was still sitting in precisely the same place and attitude; but there was no Jimmy in sight Dan wheres the baby? cried Felicity Dan looked around His jaw fell in blank amazement I never saw any one look as foolish as Dan at that moment Good gracious I dont know he said helplessly Youve been so deep in that wretched book that hes got out and dear knows where he is cried Felicity distractedly I wasnt cried Dan He MUST be in the house Ive been sitting right across the door ever since you left and he couldnt have got out unless he crawled right over me He must be in the house He isnt in the kitchen said Felicity rushing about wildly and he couldnt get into the other part of the house for I shut the hall door tight and no baby could open it--and its shut tight yet So are all the windows He MUST have gone out of that door Dan King and its your fault He DIDNT go out of this door reiterated Dan stubbornly I know that Well where is he then? He isnt here Did he melt into air? demanded Felicity Oh come and look for him all of you Dont stand round like ninnies We MUST find him before his mother gets here Dan King youre an idiot! Dan was too frightened to resent this at the time However and wherever Jimmy had gone he WAS gone so much was certain We tore about the house and yard like maniacs; we looked into every likely and unlikely place But Jimmy we could not find anymore than if he had indeed melted into air Mrs Patterson came and we had not found him Things were getting serious Uncle Roger and Peter were summoned from the field Mrs Patterson became hysterical and was taken into the spare room with such remedies as could be suggested Everybody blamed poor Dan Cecily asked him what he would feel like if Jimmy was never never found The Story Girl had a gruesome recollection of some baby at Markdale who had wandered away like that-- And they never found him till the next spring and all they found was--HIS SKELETON with the grass growing through it she whispered This beats me said Uncle Roger when a fruitless hour had elapsed I do hope that baby hasnt wandered down to the swamp It seems impossible he could walk so far; but I must go and see Felicity hand me my high boots out from under the sofa theres a girl Felicity pale and tearful dropped on her knees and lifted the cretonne frill of the sofa There his head pillowed hardly on Uncle Rogers boots lay Jimmy Patterson still sound asleep! Well Ill be--jiggered! said Uncle Roger I KNEW he never went out of the door cried Dan triumphantly When the last buggy had driven away Felicity set a batch of bread and the rest of us sat around the back porch steps in the cats light and ate cherries shooting the stones at each other Cecily was in quest of information What does it never rains but it pours mean? Oh it means if anything happens something else is sure to happen said the Story Girl Ill illustrate Theres Mrs Murphy She never had a proposal in her life till she was forty and then she had three in the one week and she was so flustered she took the wrong one and has been sorry ever since Do you see what it means now? Yes I guess so said Cecily somewhat doubtfully Later on we heard her imparting her newly acquired knowledge to Felicity in the pantry It never rains but it pours means that nobody wants to marry you for ever so long and then lots of people do CHAPTER XIV FORBIDDEN FRUIT We were all with the exception of Uncle Roger more or less grumpy in the household of King next day Perhaps our nerves had been upset by the excitement attendant on Jimmy Pattersons disappearance But it is more likely that our crankiness was the result of the supper we had eaten the previous night Even children cannot devour mince pie and cold fried pork ham and fruit cake before going to bed with entire impunity Aunt Janet had forgotten to warn Uncle Roger to keep an eye on our bedtime snacks and we ate what seemed good unto us Some of us had frightful dreams and all of us carried chips on our shoulders at breakfast Felicity and Dan began a bickering which they kept up the entire day Felicity had a natural aptitude for what we called bossing and in her mothers absence she deemed that she had a right to rule supreme She knew better than to make any attempt to assert authority over the Story Girl and Felix and I were allowed some length of tether; but Cecily Dan and Peter were expected to submit dutifully to her decrees In the main they did; but on this particular morning Dan was plainly inclined to rebel He had had time to grow sore over the things that Felicity had said to him when Jimmy Patterson was thought lost and he began the day with a flatly expressed determination that he was not going to let Felicity rule the roost It was not a pleasant day and to make matters worse it rained until late in the afternoon The Story Girl had not recovered from the mortifications of the previous day; she would not talk and she would not tell a single story; she sat on Rachel Wards chest and ate her breakfast with the air of a martyr After breakfast she washed the dishes and did the bed-room work in grim silence; then with a book under one arm and Pat under the other she betook herself to the window-seat in the upstairs hall and would not be lured from that retreat charmed we never so wisely She stroked the purring Paddy and read steadily on with maddening indifference to all our pleadings Even Cecily the meek and mild was snappish and complained of headache Peter had gone home to see his mother and Uncle Roger had gone to Markdale on business Sara Ray came up but was so snubbed by Felicity that she went home crying Felicity got the dinner by herself disdaining to ask or command assistance She banged things about and rattled the stove covers until even Cecily protested from her sofa Dan sat on the floor and whittled his sole aim and object being to make a mess and annoy Felicity in which noble ambition he succeeded perfectly I wish Aunt Janet and Uncle Alec were home said Felix Its not half so much fun having the grown-ups away as I thought it would be I wish I was back in Toronto I said sulkily The mince pie was to blame for THAT wish I wish you were Im sure said Felicity riddling the fire noisily Any one who lives with you Felicity King will always be wishing he was somewhere else said Dan I wasnt talking to you Dan King retorted Felicity Speak when youre spoken to come when youre called Oh oh oh wailed Cecily on the sofa I WISH it would stop raining I WISH my head would stop aching I WISH ma had never gone away I WISH youd leave Felicity alone Dan I wish girls had some sense said Dan--which brought the orgy of wishing to an end for the time A wishing fairy might have had the time of her life in the King kitchen that morning--particularly if she were a cynically inclined fairy But even the effects of unholy snacks wear away at length By tea-time things had brightened up The rain had ceased and the old low-raftered room was full of sunshine which danced on the shining dishes of the dresser made mosaics on the floor and flickered over the table whereon a delicious meal was spread Felicity had put on her blue muslin and looked so beautiful in it that her good humour was quite restored Cecilys headache was better and the Story Girl refreshed by an afternoon siesta came down with smiles and sparkling eyes Dan alone continued to nurse his grievances and would not even laugh when the Story Girl told us a tale brought to mind by some of the Rev Mr Scotts plums which were on the table The Rev Mr Scott was the man who thought the pulpit door must be made for speerits you know she said I heard Uncle Edward telling ever so many stories about him He was called to this congregation and he laboured here long and faithfully and was much beloved though he was very eccentric What does that mean? asked Peter Hush! It just means queer said Cecily nudging him with her elbow A common man would be queer but when its a minister its eccentric When he gets very old continued the Story Girl the Presbytery thought it was time he was retired HE didnt think so; but the Presbytery had their way because there were so many of them to one of him He was retired and a young man was called to Carlisle Mr Scott went to live in town but he came out to Carlisle very often and visited all the people regularly just the same as when he was their minister The young minister was a very good young man and tried to do his duty; but he was dreadfully afraid of meeting old Mr Scott because he had been told that the old minister was very angry at being set aside and would likely give him a sound drubbing if he ever met him One day the young minister was visiting the Crawfords in Markdale when they suddenly heard old Mr Scotts voice in the kitchen The young minister turned pale as the dead and implored Mrs Crawford to hid him But she couldnt get him out of the room and all she could do was to hide him in the china closet The young minister slipped into the china closet and old Mr Scott came into the room He talked very nicely and read and prayed They made very long prayers in those days you know; and at the end of his prayer he said Oh Lord bless the poor young man hiding in the closet Give him courage not to fear the face of man Make him a burning and a shining light to this sadly abused congregation Just imagine the feelings of the young minister in the china closet! But he came right out like a man though his face was very red as soon as Mr Scott had done praying And Mr Scott was lovely to him and shook hands and never mentioned the china closet And they were the best of friends ever afterwards How did old Mr Scott find out the young minister was in the closet? asked Felix Nobody ever knew They supposed he had seen him through the window before he came into the house and guessed he must be in the closet--because there was no way for him to get out of the room Mr Scott planted the yellow plum tree in Grandfathers time said Cecily peeling one of the plums and when he did it he said it was as Christian an act as he ever did I wonder what he meant I dont see anything very Christian about planting a tree I do said the Story Girl sagely When next we assembled ourselves together it was after milking and the cares of the day were done with We foregathered in the balsam-fragrant aisles of the fir wood and ate early August apples to such an extent that the Story Girl said we made her think of the Irishmans pig An Irishman who lived at Markdale had a little pig she said and he gave it a pailful of mush The pig ate the whole pailful and then the Irishman put the pig IN the pail and it didnt fill more than half the pail Now how was that when it held a whole pailful of mush? This seemed to be a rather unanswerable kind of conundrum We discussed the problem as we roamed the wood and Dan and Peter almost quarrelled over it Dan maintaining that the thing was impossible and Peter being of the opinion that the mush was somehow made thicker in the process of being eaten and so took up less room During the discussion we came out to the fence of the hill pasture where grew the bad berry bushes Just what these bad berries were I cannot tell We never knew their real name They were small red-clustered berries of a glossy seductive appearance and we were forbidden to eat them because it was thought they might be poisonous Dan picked a cluster and held it up Dan King dont you DARE eat those berries said Felicity in her bossiest tone Theyre poison Drop them right away Now Dan had not had the slightest intention of eating the berries But at Felicitys prohibition the rebellion which had smouldered in him all day broke into sudden flame He would show her! Ill eat them if I please Felicity King he said in a fury I dont believe theyre poison Look here! Dan crammed the whole bunch into his capacious mouth and chewed it up They taste great he said smacking; and he ate two more clusters regardless of our horror-stricken protestations and Felicitys pleadings We feared that Dan would drop dead on the spot But nothing occurred immediately When an hour had passed we concluded that the bad berries were not poison after all and we looked upon Dan as quite a hero for daring to eat them I knew they wouldnt hurt me he said loftily Felicitys so fond of making a fuss over everything Nevertheless when it grew dark and we returned to the house I noticed that Dan was rather pale and quiet He lay down on the kitchen sofa Dont you feel all right Dan? I whispered anxiously Shut up he said I shut up Felicity and Cecily were setting out a lunch in the pantry when we were all startled by a loud groan from the sofa Oh Im sick--Im awful sick said Dan abjectly all the defiance and bravado gone out of him We all went to pieces except Cecily who alone retained her presence of mind Have you got a pain in your stomach? she demanded Ive got an awful pain here if thats where my stomach is moaned Dan putting his hand on a portion of his anatomy considerably below his stomach Oh--oh--oh! Go for Uncle Roger commanded Cecily pale but composed Felicity put on the kettle Dan Im going to give you mustard and warm water The mustard and warm water produced its proper effect promptly but gave Dan no relief He continued to writhe and groan Uncle Roger who had been summoned from his own place went at once for the doctor telling Peter to go down the hill for Mrs Ray Peter went but returned accompanied by Sara only Mrs Ray and Judy Pineau were both away Sara might better have stayed home; she was of no use and could only add to the general confusion wandering aimlessly about crying and asking if Dan was going to die Cecily took charge of things Felicity might charm the palate and the Story Girl bind captive the soul; but when pain and sickness wrung the brow it was Cecily who was the ministering angel She made the writhing Dan go to bed She made him swallow every available antidote which was recommended in the doctors book; and she applied hot cloths to him until her faithful little hands were half scalded off There was no doubt Dan was suffering intense pain He moaned and writhed and cried for his mother Oh isnt it dreadful! said Felicity wringing her hands as she walked the kitchen floor Oh why doesnt the doctor come? I TOLD Dan the bad berries were poison But surely they cant kill people ALTOGETHER Pas cousin died of eating something forty years ago sobbed Sara Ray Hold your tongue said Peter in a fierce whisper You oughter have more sense than to say such things to the girls They dont want to be any worse scared than they are But Pas cousin DID die reiterated Sara My Aunt Jane used to rub whisky on for a pain suggested Peter We havent any whisky said Felicity disapprovingly This is a temperance house But rubbing whisky on the OUTSIDE isnt any harm argued Peter Its only when you take it inside it is bad for you Well we havent any anyhow said Felicity I suppose blueberry wine wouldnt do in its place? Peter did not think blueberry wine would be any good It was ten oclock before Dan began to get better; but from that time he improved rapidly When the doctor who had been away from home when Uncle Roger reached Markdale came at half past ten he found his patient very weak and white but free from pain Dr Grier patted Cecily on the head told her she was a little brick and had done just the right thing examined some of the fatal berries and gave it as his opinion that they were probably poisonous administered some powders to Dan and advised him not to tamper with forbidden fruit in future and went away Mrs Ray now appeared looking for Sara and said she would stay all night with us Ill be much obliged to you if you will said Uncle Roger I feel a bit shook I urged Janet and Alec to go to Halifax and took the responsibility of the children while they were away but I didnt know what I was letting myself in for If anything had happened I could never have forgiven myself--though I believe its beyond the power of mortal man to keep watch over the things children WILL eat Now you young fry get straight off to your beds Dan is out of danger and you cant do any more good Not that any of you have done much except Cecily Shes got a head of her shoulders Its been a horrid day all through said Felicity drearily as we climbed the stairs I suppose we made it horrid ourselves said the Story Girl candidly But itll be a good story to tell sometime she added Im awful tired and thankful sighed Cecily We all felt that way CHAPTER XV A DISOBEDIENT BROTHER Dan was his own man again in the morning though rather pale and weak; he wanted to get up but Cecily ordered him to stay in bed Fortunately Felicity forgot to repeat the command so Dan did stay in bed Cecily carried his meals to him and read a Henty book to him all her spare time The Story Girl went up and told him wondrous tales; and Sara Ray brought him a pudding she had made herself Saras intentions were good but the pudding--well Dan fed most of it to Paddy who had curled himself up at the foot of the bed giving the world assurance of a cat by his mellifluous purring Aint he just a great old fellow? said Dan He knows Im kind of sick just as well as a human He never pays no attention to me when Im well Felix and Peter and I were required to help Uncle Roger in some carpentering work that day and Felicity indulged in one of the house-cleaning orgies so dear to her soul; so that it was evening before we were all free to meet in the orchard and loll on the grasses of Uncle Stephens Walk In August it was a place of shady sweetness fragrant with the odour of ripening apples full of dear delicate shadows Through its openings we looked afar to the blue rims of the hills and over green old tranquil fields lying the sunset glow Overhead the lacing leaves made a green murmurous roof There was no such thing as hurry in the world while we lingered there and talked of cabbages and kings A tale of the Story Girls wherein princes were thicker than blackberries and queens as common as buttercups led to our discussion of kings We wondered what it would be like to be a king Peter thought it would be fine only kind of inconvenient wearing a crown all the time Oh but they dont said the Story Girl Maybe they used to once but now they wear hats The crowns are just for special occasions They look very much like other people if you can go by their photographs I dont believe it would be much fun as a steady thing said Cecily Id like to SEE a queen though That is one thing I have against the Island--you never have a chance to see things like that here The Prince of Wales was in Charlottetown once said Peter My Aunt Jane saw him quite close by That was before we were born and such a thing wont happen again until after were dead said Cecily with very unusual pessimism I think queens and kings were thicker long ago said the Story Girl They do seem dreadfully scarce now There isnt one in this country anywhere Perhaps Ill get a glimpse of some when I go to Europe Well the Story Girl was destined to stand before kings herself and she was to be one whom they delighted to honour But we did not know that as we sat in the old orchard We thought it quite sufficiently marvellous that she should expect to have the chance of just seeing them Can a queen do exactly as she pleases? Sara Ray wanted to know Not nowadays explained the Story Girl Then I dont see any use in being one Sara decided A king cant do as he pleases now either said Felix If he tries to and if it isnt what pleases other people the Parliament or something squelches him Isnt squelch a lovely word? said the Story Girl irrelevantly Its so expressive Squ-u-e-l-ch! Certainly it was a lovely word as the Story Girl said it Even a king would not have minded being squelched if it were done to music like that Uncle Roger says that Martin Forbes wife has squelched HIM said Felicity He says Martin cant call his soul his own since he was married Im glad of it said Cecily vindictively We all stared This was so very unlike Cecily Martin Forbes is the brother of a horrid man in Summerside who called me Johnny thats why she explained He was visiting here with his wife two years ago and he called me Johnny every time he spoke to me Just you fancy! Ill NEVER forgive him That isnt a Christian spirit said Felicity rebukingly I dont care Would YOU forgive James Forbes if he had called YOU Johnny? demanded Cecily I know a story about Martin Forbes grandfather said the Story Girl Long ago they didnt have any choir in the Carlisle church--just a precentor you know But at last they got a choir and Andrew McPherson was to sing bass in it Old Mr Forbes hadnt gone to church for years because he was so rheumatic but he went the first Sunday the choir sang because he had never heard any one sing bass and wanted to hear what it was like Grandfather King asked him what he thought of the choir Mr Forbes said it was verra guid but as for Andrews bass there was nae bass aboot it--it was just a bur-r-r-r the hale time If you could have heard the Story Girls bur-r-r-r! Not old Mr Forbes himself could have invested it with more of Doric scorn We rolled over in the cool grass and screamed with laughter Poor Dan said Cecily compassionately Hes up there all alone in his room missing all the fun I suppose its mean of us to be having such a good time here when he has to stay in bed If Dan hadnt done wrong eating the bad berries when he was told not to he wouldnt be sick said Felicity Youre bound to catch it when you do wrong It was just a Providence he didnt die That makes me think of another story about old Mr Scott said the Story Girl You know I told you he was very angry because the Presbytery made him retire There were two ministers in particular he blamed for being at the bottom of it One time a friend of his was trying to console him and said to him You should be resigned to the will of Providence Providence had nothing to do with it said old Mr Scott Twas the McCloskeys and the devil You shouldnt speak of the--the--DEVIL said Felicity rather shocked Well thats just what Mr Scott said Oh its all right for a MINISTER to speak of him But it isnt nice for little girls If you HAVE to speak of--of--him--you might say the Old Scratch That is what mother calls him Twas the McCloskeys and the Old Scratch said the Story Girl reflectively as if she were trying to see which version was the more effective It wouldnt do she decided I dont think its any harm to mention the--the--that person when youre telling a story said Cecily Its only in plain talking it doesnt do It sounds too much like swearing then I know another story about Mr Scott said the Story Girl Not long after he was married his wife wasnt quite ready for church one morning when it was time to go So just to teach her a lesson he drove off alone and left her to walk all the way--it was nearly two miles--in the heat and dust She took it very quietly Its the best way I guess when youre married to a man like old Mr Scott But just a few Sundays after wasnt he late himself! I suppose Mrs Scott thought that what was sauce for the goose was sauce for the gander for she slipped out and drove off to church as he had done Old Mr Scott finally arrived at the church pretty hot and dusty and in none too good a temper He went into the pulpit leaned over it and looked at his wife sitting calmly in her pew at the side It was cleverly done he said right out loud BUT DINNA TRY IT AGAIN! In the midst of our laughter Pat came down the Walk his stately tail waving over the grasses He proved to be the precursor of Dan clothed and in his right mind Do you think you should have got up Dan? said Cecily anxiously I had to said Dan The window was open and it was moren I could stand to hear you fellows laughing down here and me missing it all Sides Im all right again I feel fine I guess this will be a lesson to you Dan King said Felicity in her most maddening tone I guess you wont forget it in a hurry You wont go eating the bad berries another time when youre told not to Dan had picked out a soft spot in the grass for himself and was in the act of sitting down when Felicitys tactful speech arrested him midway He straightened up and turned a wrathful face on his provoking sister Then red with indignation but without a word he stalked up the walk Now hes gone off mad said Cecily reproachfully Oh Felicity why couldnt you have held your tongue? Why what did I say to make him mad? asked Felicity in honest perplexity I think its awful for brothers and sisters to be always quarrelling sighed Cecily The Cowans fight all the time; and you and Dan will soon be as bad Oh talk sense said Felicity Dans got so touchy it isnt safe to speak to him I should think hed be sorry for all the trouble he made last night But you just back him up in everything Cecily I dont! You do! And youve no business to specially when mothers away She left ME in charge You didnt take much charge last night when Dan got sick said Felix maliciously Felicity had told him at tea that night he was getting fatter than ever This was his tit-for-tat You were pretty glad to leave it all to Cecily then Whos talking to you? said Felicity Now look here said the Story Girl the first thing we know well all be quarrelling and then some of us will sulk all day to-morrow Its dreadful to spoil a whole day Just lets all sit still and count a hundred before we say another word We sat still and counted the hundred When Cecily finished she got up and went in search of Dan resolved to soothe his wounded feelings Felicity called after her to tell Dan there was a jam turnover she had put away in the pantry specially for him Felix held out to Felicity a remarkably fine apple which he had been saving for his own consumption; and the Story Girl began a tale of an enchanted maiden in a castle by the sea; but we never heard the end of it For just as the evening star was looking whitely through the rosy window of the west Cecily came flying through the orchard wringing her hands Oh come come quick she gasped Dans eating the bad berries again--hes et a whole bunch of them--he says hell show Felicity I cant stop him Come you and try We rose in a body and rushed towards the house In the yard we encountered Dan emerging from the fir wood and champing the fatal berries with unrepentant relish Dan King do you want to commit suicide? demanded the Story Girl Look here Dan I expostulated You shouldnt do this Think how sick you were last night and all the trouble you made for everybody Dont eat any more theres a good chap All right said Dan Ive et all I want They taste fine I dont believe it was them made me sick But now that his anger was over he looked a little frightened Felicity was not there We found her in the kitchen lighting up the fire Bev fill the kettle with water and put it on to heat she said in a resigned tone If Dans going to be sick again weve got to be ready for it I wish mother was home thats all I hope shell never go away again Dan King you just wait till I tell her of the way youve acted Fudge! I aint going to be sick said Dan And if YOU begin telling tales Felicity King ILL tell some too I know how many eggs mother said you could use while she was away--and I know how many you HAVE used I counted So youd better mind your own business Miss A nice way to talk to your sister when you may be dead in an hours time! retorted Felicity in tears between her anger and her real alarm about Dan But in an hours time Dan was still in good health and announced his intention of going to bed He went and was soon sleeping as peacefully as if he had nothing on either conscience or stomach But Felicity declared she meant to keep the water hot until all danger was past; and we sat up to keep her company We were sitting there when Uncle Roger walked in at eleven oclock What on earth are you young fry doing up at this time of night? he asked angrily You should have been in your beds two hours ago And with a roaring fire on a night thats hot enough to melt a brass monkey! Have you taken leave of your senses? Its because of Dan explained Felicity wearily He went and et more of the bad berries--a whole lot of them--and we were sure hed be sick again But he hasnt been yet and now hes asleep Is that boy stark staring mad? said Uncle Roger It was Felicitys fault cried Cecily who always took Dans part through evil report and good report She told him she guessed hed learned a lesson and wouldnt do what shed told him not to again So he went and et them because she vexed him so Felicity King if you dont watch out youll grow up into the sort of woman who drives her husband to drink said Uncle Roger gravely How could I tell Dan would act so like a mule! cried Felicity Get off to bed every one of you Its a thankful man Ill be when your father and mother come home The wretched bachelor who undertakes to look after a houseful of children like you is to be pitied Nobody will ever catch me doing it again Felicity is there anything fit to eat in the pantry? That last question was the most unkindest cut of all Felicity could have forgiven Uncle Roger anything but that It really was unpardonable She confided to me as we climbed the stairs that she hated Uncle Roger Her red lips quivered and the tears of wounded pride brimmed over in her beautiful blue eyes In the dim candle-light she looked unbelievably pretty and appealing I put my arm about her and gave her a cousinly salute Never you mind him Felicity I said Hes only a grown-up CHAPTER XVI THE GHOSTLY BELL Friday was a comfortable day in the household of King Everybody was in good humour The Story Girl sparkled through several tales that ranged from the afrites and jinns of Eastern myth through the piping days of chivalry down to the homely anecdotes of Carlisle workaday folks She was in turn an Oriental princess behind a silken veil the bride who followed her bridegroom to the wars of Palestine disguised as a page the gallant lady who ransomed her diamond necklace by dancing a coranto with a highwayman on a moonlit heath and Buskirks girl who joined the Sons and Daughters of Temperance just to see what was into it; and in each impersonation she was so thoroughly the thing impersonated that it was a matter of surprise to us when she emerged from each our own familiar Story Girl again Cecily and Sara Ray found a sweet new knitted lace pattern in an old magazine and spent a happy afternoon learning it and talking secrets Chancing--accidentally I vow--to overhear certain of these secrets I learned that Sara Ray had named an apple for Johnny Price-- and Cecily trues you live there was eight seeds in it and you know eight means they both love --while Cecily admitted that Willy Fraser had written on his slate and showed it to her If you love me as I love you No knife can cut our love in two -- but Sara Ray NEVER you breathe this to a living soul Felix also averred that he heard Sara ask Cecily very seriously Cecily how old must we be before we can have a REAL beau? But Sara always denied it; so I am inclined to believe Felix simply made it up himself Paddy distinguished himself by catching a rat and being intolerably conceited about it--until Sara Ray cured him by calling him a dear sweet cat and kissing him between the ears Then Pat sneaked abjectly off his tail drooping He resented being called a sweet cat He had a sense of humour had Pat Very few cats have; and most of them have such an inordinate appetite for flattery that they will swallow any amount of it and thrive thereon Paddy had a finer taste The Story Girl and I were the only ones who could pay him compliments to his liking The Story Girl would box his ears with her fist and say Bless your gray heart Paddy youre a good sort of old rascal and Pat would purr his satisfaction; I used to take a handful of the skin on his back shake him gently and say Pat youve forgotten more than any human being ever knew and I vow Paddy would lick his chops with delight But to be called a sweet cat! Oh Sara Sara! Felicity tried--and had the most gratifying luck with--a new and complicated cake recipe--a gorgeous compound of a plumminess to make your mouth water The number of eggs she used in it would have shocked Aunt Janets thrifty soul but that cake like beauty was its own excuse Uncle Roger ate three slices of it at tea-time and told Felicity she was an artist The poor man meant it as a compliment; but Felicity who knew Uncle Blair was an artist and had a poor opinion of such fry looked indignant and retorted indeed she wasnt! Peter says theres any amount of raspberries back in the maple clearing said Dan Sposen we all go after tea and pick some? Id like to sighed Felicity but wed come home tired and with all the milking to do You boys better go alone Peter and I will attend to the milking for one evening said Uncle Roger You can all go I have an idea that a raspberry pie for to-morrow night when the folks come home would hit the right spot Accordingly after tea we all set off armed with jugs and cups Felicity thoughtful creature also took a small basketful of jelly cookies along with her We had to go back through the maple woods to the extreme end of Uncle Rogers farm--a pretty walk through a world of green whispering boughs and spice-sweet ferns and shifting patches of sunlight The raspberries were plentiful and we were not long in filling our receptacles Then we foregathered around a tiny wood spring cold and pellucid under its young maples and ate the jelly cookies; and the Story Girl told us a tale of a haunted spring in a mountain glen where a fair white lady dwelt who pledged all comers in a golden cup with jewels bright And if you drank of the cup with her said the Story Girl her eyes glowing through the emerald dusk about us you were never seen in the world again; you were whisked straightway to fairyland and lived there with a fairy bride And you never WANTED to come back to earth because when you drank of the magic cup you forgot all your past life except for one day in every year when you were allowed to remember it I wish there was such a place as fairyland--and a way to get to it said Cecily I think there IS such a place--in spite of Uncle Edward said the Story Girl dreamily and I think there is a way of getting there too if we could only find it Well the Story Girl was right There is such a place as fairyland--but only children can find the way to it And they do not know that it is fairyland until they have grown so old that they forget the way One bitter day when they seek it and cannot find it they realize what they have lost; and that is the tragedy of life On that day the gates of Eden are shut behind them and the age of gold is over Henceforth they must dwell in the common light of common day Only a few who remain children at heart can ever find that fair lost path again; and blessed are they above mortals They and only they can bring us tidings from that dear country where we once sojourned and from which we must evermore be exiles The world calls them its singers and poets and artists and story-tellers; but they are just people who have never forgotten the way to fairyland As we sat there the Awkward Man passed by with his gun over his shoulder and his dog at his side He did not look like an awkward man there in the heart of the maple woods He strode along right masterfully and lifted his head with the air of one who was monarch of all he surveyed The Story Girl kissed her fingertips to him with the delightful audacity which was a part of her; and the Awkward Man plucked off his hat and swept her a stately and graceful bow I dont understand why they call him the awkward man said Cecily when he was out of earshot Youd understand why if you ever saw him at a party or a picnic said Felicity trying to pass plates and dropping them whenever a woman looked at him They say its pitiful to see him I must get well acquainted with that man next summer said the Story Girl If I put it off any longer it will be too late Im growing so fast Aunt Olivia says Ill have to wear ankle skirts next summer If I begin to look grown-up hell get frightened of me and then Ill never find out the Golden Milestone mystery Do you think hell ever tell you who Alice is? I asked I have a notion who Alice is already said the mysterious creature But she would tell us nothing more When the jelly cookies were all eaten it was high time to be moving homeward for when the dark comes down there are more comfortable places than a rustling maple wood and the precincts of a possibly enchanted spring When we reached the foot of the orchard and entered it through a gap in the hedge it was the magical mystical time of between lights Off to the west was a daffodil glow hanging over the valley of lost sunsets and Grandfather Kings huge willow rose up against it like a rounded mountain of foliage In the east above the maple woods was a silvery sheen that hinted the moonrise But the orchard was a place of shadows and mysterious sounds Midway up the open space in its heart we met Peter; and if ever a boy was given over to sheer terror that boy was Peter His face was as white as a sunburned face could be and his eyes were brimmed with panic Peter what is the matter? cried Cecily Theres--SOMETHING--in the house RINGING A BELL said Peter in a shaking voice Not the Story Girl herself could have invested that something with more of creepy horror We all drew close together I felt a crinkly feeling along my back which I had never known before If Peter had not been so manifestly frightened we might have thought he was trying to pass a joke on us But such abject terror as his could not be counterfeited Nonsense! said Felicity but her voice shook There isnt a bell in the house to ring You must have imagined it Peter Or else Uncle Roger is trying to fool us Your Uncle Roger went to Markdale right after milking said Peter He locked up the house and gave me the key There wasnt a soul in it then that Im sure of I druv the cows to the pasture and I got back about fifteen minutes ago I set down on the front door steps for a moment and all at once I heard a bell ring in the house eight times I tell you I was skeered I made a bolt for the orchard--and you wont catch me going near that house till your Uncle Roger comes home You wouldnt catch any of us doing it We were almost as badly scared as Peter There we stood in a huddled demoralized group Oh what an eerie place that orchard was! What shadows! What noises! What spooky swooping of bats! You COULDNT look every way at once and goodness only knew what might be behind you! There CANT be anybody in the house said Felicity Well heres the key--go and see for yourself said Peter Felicity had no intention of going and seeing I think you boys ought to go she said retreating behind the defence of sex You ought to be braver than girls But we aint said Felix candidly I wouldnt be much scared of anything REAL But a haunted house is a different thing I always thought something had to be done in a place before it could be haunted said Cecily Somebody killed or something like that you know Nothing like that ever happened in our family The Kings have always been respectable Perhaps it is Emily Kings ghost whispered Felix She never appeared anywhere but in the orchard said the Story Girl Oh oh children isnt there something under Uncle Alecs tree? We peered fearfully through the gloom There WAS something--something that wavered and fluttered--advanced--retreated-- Thats only my old apron said Felicity I hung it there to-day when I was looking for the white hens nest Oh what shall we do? Uncle Roger may not be back for hours I CANT believe theres anything in the house Maybe its only Peg Bowen suggested Dan There was not a great deal of comfort in this We were almost as much afraid of Peg Bowen as we would be of any spectral visitant Peter scoffed at the idea Peg Bowen wasnt in the house before your Uncle Roger locked it up and how could she get in afterwards? he said No it isnt Peg Bowen Its SOMETHING that WALKS I know a story about a ghost said the Story Girl the ruling passion strong even in extremity It is about a ghost with eyeholes but no eyes-- Dont cried Cecily hysterically Dont you go on! Dont you say another word! I cant bear it! Dont you! The Story Girl didnt But she had said enough There was something in the quality of a ghost with eyeholes but no eyes that froze our young blood There never were in all the world six more badly scared children than those who huddled in the old King orchard that August night All at once--something--leaped from the bough of a tree and alighted before us We split the air with a simultaneous shriek We would have run one and all if there had been anywhere to run to But there wasnt--all around us were only those shadowy arcades Then we saw with shame that it was only our Paddy Pat Pat I said picking him up feeling a certain comfort in his soft solid body Stay with us old fellow But Pat would none of us He struggled out of my clasp and disappeared over the long grasses with soundless leaps He was no longer our tame domestic well acquainted Paddy He was a strange furtive animal--a questing beast Presently the moon rose; but this only made matters worse The shadows had been still before; now they moved and danced as the night wind tossed the boughs The old house with its dreadful secret was white and clear against the dark background of spruces We were woefully tired but we could not sit down because the grass was reeking with dew The Family Ghost only appears in daylight said the Story Girl I wouldnt mind seeing a ghost in daylight But after dark is another thing Theres no such thing as a ghost I said contemptuously Oh how I wished I could believe it! Then what rung that bell? said Peter Bells dont ring of themselves I spose specially when there aint any in the house to ring Oh will Uncle Roger never come home! sobbed Felicity I know hell laugh at us awful but its better to be laughed at than scared like this Uncle Roger did not come until nearly ten Never was there a more welcome sound than the rumble of his wheels in the lane We ran to the orchard gate and swarmed across the yard just as Uncle Roger alighted at the front door He stared at us in the moonlight Have you tormented any one into eating more bad berries Felicity? he demanded Oh Uncle Roger dont go in implored Felicity seriously Theres something dreadful in there--something that rings a bell Peter heard it Dont go in Theres no use asking the meaning of this I suppose said Uncle Roger with the calm of despair Ive gave up trying to fathom you young ones Peter wheres the key? What yarn have you been telling? I DID hear a bell ring said Peter stubbornly Uncle Roger unlocked and flung open the front door As he did so clear and sweet rang out ten bell-like chimes Thats what I heard cried Peter Theres the bell! We had to wait until Uncle Roger stopped laughing before we heard the explanation We thought he never WOULD stop Thats Grandfather Kings old clock striking he said as soon as he was able to speak Sammy Prott came along after tea when you were away to the forge Peter and I gave him permission to clean the old clock He had it going merrily in no time And now it has almost frightened you poor little monkeys to death We heard Uncle Roger chuckling all the way to the barn Uncle Roger can laugh said Cecily with a quiver in her voice but its no laughing matter to be so scared I just feel sick I was so frightened I wouldnt mind if hed laugh once and have it done with it said Felicity bitterly But hell laugh at us for a year and tell the story to every soul that comes to the place You cant blame him for that said the Story Girl I shall tell it too I dont care if the joke is as much on myself as any one A story is a story no matter who its on But it IS hateful to be laughed at--and grown-ups always do it I never will when Im grown up Ill remember better Its all Peters fault said Felicity I do think he might have had more sense than to take a clock striking for a bell ringing I never heard that kind of a strike before protested Peter It dont sound a bit like other clocks And the door was shut and the sound kind o muffled Its all very fine to say you would have known what it was but I dont believe you would I wouldnt have said the Story Girl honestly I thought it WAS a bell when I heard it and the door open too Let us be fair Felicity Im dreadful tired sighed Cecily We were all dreadful tired for this was the third night of late hours and nerve racking strain But it was over two hours since we had eaten the cookies and Felicity suggested that a saucerful apiece of raspberries and cream would not be hard to take It was not for any one but Cecily who couldnt swallow a mouthful Im glad father and mother will be back to-morrow night she said Its too exciting when theyre away Thats my opinion CHAPTER XVII THE PROOF OF THE PUDDING Felicity was cumbered with many cares the next morning For one thing the whole house must be put in apple pie order; and for another an elaborate supper must be prepared for the expected return of the travellers that night Felicity devoted her whole attention to this and left the secondary preparation of the regular meals to Cecily and the Story Girl It was agreed that the latter was to make a cornmeal pudding for dinner In spite of her disaster with the bread the Story Girl had been taking cooking lessons from Felicity all the week and getting on tolerably well although mindful of her former mistake she never ventured on anything without Felicitys approval But Felicity had no time to oversee her this morning You must attend to the pudding yourself she said The recipes so plain and simple even you cant go astray and if theres anything you dont understand you can ask me But dont bother me if you can help it The Story Girl did not bother her once The pudding was concocted and baked as the Story Girl proudly informed us when we came to the dinner-table all on her own hook She was very proud of it; and certainly as far as appearance went it justified her triumph The slices were smooth and golden; and smothered in the luscious maple sugar sauce which Cecily had compounded were very fair to view Nevertheless although none of us not even Uncle Roger or Felicity said a word at the time for fear of hurting the Story Girls feelings the pudding did not taste exactly as it should It was tough--decidedly tough--and lacked the richness of flavour which was customary in Aunt Janets cornmeal puddings If it had not been for the abundant supply of sauce it would have been very dry eating indeed Eaten it was however to the last crumb If it were not just what a cornmeal pudding might be the rest of the bill of fare had been extra good and our appetites matched it I wish I was twins sos I could eat more said Dan when he simply had to stop What good would being twins do you? asked Peter People who squint cant eat any more than people who dont squint can they? We could not see any connection between Peters two questions What has squinting got to do with twins? asked Dan Why twins are just people that squint arent they? said Peter We thought he was trying to be funny until we found out that he was quite in earnest Then we laughed until Peter got sulky I dont care he said Hows a fellow to know? Tommy and Adam Cowan over at Markdale are twins; and theyre both cross-eyed So I sposed that was what being twins meant Its all very fine for you fellows to laugh I never went to school half as much as you did; and you was brought up in Toronto too If youd worked out ever since you was seven and just got to school in the winter thered be lots of things you wouldnt know either Never mind Peter said Cecily You know lots of things they dont But Peter was not to be conciliated and took himself off in high dudgeon To be laughed at before Felicity--to be laughed at BY Felicity--was something he could not endure Let Cecily and the Story Girl cackle all they wanted to and let those stuck-up Toronto boys grin like chessy-cats; but when Felicity laughed at him the iron entered into Peters soul If the Story Girl laughed at Peter the mills of the gods ground out his revenge for him in mid-afternoon Felicity having used up all the available cooking materials in the house had to stop perforce; and she now determined to stuff two new pincushions she had been making for her room We heard her rummaging in the pantry as we sat on the cool spruce-shadowed cellar door outside where Uncle Roger was showing us how to make elderberry pop-guns Presently she came out frowning Cecily do you know where mother put the sawdust she emptied out of that old beaded pincushion of Grandmother Kings after she had sifted the needles out of it? I thought it was in the tin box So it is said Cecily It isnt There isnt a speck of sawdust in that box The Story Girls face wore a quite indescribable expression compound of horror and shame She need not have confessed If she had but held her tongue the mystery of the sawdusts disappearance might have forever remained a mystery She WOULD have held her tongue as she afterwards confided to me if it had not been for a horrible fear which flashed into her mind that possibly sawdust puddings were not healthy for people to eat--especially if there might be needles in them--and that if any mischief had been done in that direction it was her duty to undo it if possible at any cost of ridicule to herself Oh Felicity she said her voice expressing a very anguish of humiliation I--I--thought that stuff in the box was cornmeal and used it to make the pudding Felicity and Cecily stared blankly at the Story Girl We boys began to laugh but were checked midway by Uncle Roger He was rocking himself back and forth with his hand pressed against his stomach Oh he groaned Ive been wondering what these sharp pains Ive been feeling ever since dinner meant I know now I must have swallowed a needle--several needles perhaps Im done for! The poor Story Girl went very white Oh Uncle Roger could it be possible? You COULDNT have swallowed a needle without knowing it It would have stuck in your tongue or teeth I didnt chew the pudding groaned Uncle Roger It was too tough--I just swallowed the chunks whole He groaned and twisted and doubled himself up But he overdid it He was not as good an actor as the Story Girl Felicity looked scornfully at him Uncle Roger you are not one bit sick she said deliberately You are just putting on Felicity if I die from the effects of eating sawdust pudding flavoured with needles youll be sorry you ever said such a thing to your poor old uncle said Uncle Roger reproachfully Even if there were no needles in it sixty-year-old sawdust cant be good for my tummy I daresay it wasnt even clean Well you know every one has to eat a peck of dirt in his life giggled Felicity But nobody has to eat it all at once retorted Uncle Roger with another groan Oh Sara Stanley its a thankful man I am that your Aunt Olivia is to be home to-night Youd have me kilt entirely by another day I believe you did it on purpose to have a story to tell Uncle Roger hobbled off to the barn still holding on to his stomach Do you think he really feels sick? asked the Story Girl anxiously No I dont said Felicity You neednt worry over him Theres nothing the matter with him I dont believe there were any needles in that sawdust Mother sifted it very carefully I know a story about a man whose son swallowed a mouse said the Story Girl who would probably have known a story and tried to tell it if she were being led to the stake And he ran and wakened up a very tired doctor just as he had got to sleep Oh doctor my son has swallowed a mouse he cried What shall I do? Tell him to swallow a cat roared the poor doctor and slammed his door Now if Uncle Roger has swallowed any needles maybe it would make it all right if he swallowed a pincushion We all laughed But Felicity soon grew sober It seems awful to think of eating a sawdust pudding How on earth did you make such a mistake? It looked just like cornmeal said the Story Girl going from white to red in her shame Well Im going to give up trying to cook and stick to things I can do And if ever one of you mentions sawdust pudding to me Ill never tell you another story as long as I live The threat was effectual Never did we mention that unholy pudding But the Story Girl could not so impose silence on the grown-ups especially Uncle Roger He tormented her for the rest of the summer Never a breakfast did he sit down to without gravely inquiring if they were sure there was no sawdust in the porridge Not a tweak of rheumatism did he feel but he vowed it was due to a needle travelling about his body And Aunt Olivia was warned to label all the pincushions in the house Contents sawdust; not intended for puddings CHAPTER XVIII HOW KISSING WAS DISCOVERED An August evening calm golden dewless can be very lovely At sunset Felicity Cecily and Sara Ray Dan Felix and I were in the orchard sitting on the cool grasses at the base of the Pulpit Stone In the west was a field of crocus sky over which pale cloud blossoms were scattered Uncle Roger had gone to the station to meet the travellers and the dining-room table was spread with a feast of fat things Its been a jolly week take it all round said Felix but Im glad the grown-ups are coming back to-night especially Uncle Alec I wonder if theyll bring us anything said Dan Im thinking long to hear all about the wedding said Felicity who was braiding timothy stalks into a collar for Pat You girls are always thinking about weddings and getting married said Dan contemptuously We aint said Felicity indignantly I am NEVER going to get married I think it is just horrid so there! I guess you think it would be a good deal horrider not to be said Dan It depends on who youre married to said Cecily gravely seeing that Felicity disdained reply If you got a man like father it would be all right But SPOSEN you got one like Andrew Ward? Hes so mean and cross to his wife that she tells him every day she wishes shed never set eyes on him Perhaps thats WHY hes mean and cross said Felix I tell you it isnt always the mans fault said Dan darkly When I get married Ill be good to my wife but I mean to be boss When I open my mouth my word will be law If your word is as big as your mouth I guess it will be said Felicity cruelly I pity the man who gets you Felicity King thats all retorted Dan Now dont fight implored Cecily Whos fighting? demanded Dan Felicity thinks she can say anything she likes to me but Ill show her different Probably in spite of Cecilys efforts a bitter spat would have resulted between Dan and Felicity had not a diversion been effected at that moment by the Story Girl who came slowly down Uncle Stephens Walk Just look how the Story Girl has got herself up! said Felicity Why shes no more than decent! The Story Girl was barefooted and barearmed having rolled the sleeves of her pink gingham up to her shoulders Around her waist was twisted a girdle of the blood-red roses that bloomed in Aunt Olivias garden; on her sleek curls she wore a chaplet of them; and her hands were full of them She paused under the outmost tree in a golden-green gloom and laughed at us over a big branch Her wild subtle nameless charm clothed her as with a garment We always remembered the picture she made there; and in later days when we read Tennysons poems at a college desk we knew exactly how an oread peering through the green leaves on some haunted knoll of many fountained Ida must look Felicity said the Story Girl reproachfully what have you been doing to Peter? Hes up there sulking in the granary and he wont come down and he says its your fault You must have hurt his feelings dreadfully I dont know about his feelings said Felicity with an angry toss of her shining head but I guess I made his ears tingle all right I boxed them both good and hard Oh Felicity! What for? Well he tried to kiss me thats what for! said Felicity turning very red As if I would let a hired boy kiss me! I guess Master Peter wont try anything like that again in a hurry The Story Girl came out of her shadows and sat down beside us on the grass Well in that case she said gravely I think you did right to slap his ears--not because he is a hired boy but because it would be impertinent in ANY boy But talking of kissing makes me think of a story I found in Aunt Olivias scrapbook the other day Wouldnt you like to hear it? It is called How Kissing Was Discovered Wasnt kissing always discovered? asked Dan Not according to this story It was just discovered accidentally Well lets hear about it said Felix although I think kissings awful silly and it wouldnt have mattered much if it hadnt ever been discovered The Story Girl scattered her roses around her on the grass and clasped her slim hands over her knees Gazing dreamily afar at the tinted sky between the apple trees as if she were looking back to the merry days of the worlds gay youth she began her voice giving to the words and fancies of the old tale the delicacy of hoar frost and the crystal sparkle of dew It happened long long ago in Greece--where so many other beautiful things happened Before that nobody had ever heard of kissing And then it was just discovered in the twinkling of an eye And a man wrote it down and the account has been preserved ever since There was a young shepherd named Glaucon--a very handsome young shepherd--who lived in a little village called Thebes It became a very great and famous city afterwards but at this time it was only a little village very quiet and simple Too quiet for Glaucons liking He grew tired of it and he thought he would like to go away from home and see something of the world So he took his knapsack and his shepherds crook and wandered away until he came to Thessaly That is the land of the gods hill you know The name of the hill was Olympus But it has nothing to do with this story This happened on another mountain--Mount Pelion Glaucon hired himself to a wealthy man who had a great many sheep And every day Glaucon had to lead the sheep up to pasture on Mount Pelion and watch them while they ate There was nothing else to do and he would have found the time very long if he had not been able to play on a flute So he played very often and very beautifully as he sat under the trees and watched the wonderful blue sea afar off and thought about Aglaia Aglaia was his masters daughter She was so sweet and beautiful that Glaucon fell in love with her the very moment he first saw her; and when he was not playing his flute on the mountain he was thinking about Aglaia and dreaming that some day he might have flocks of his own and a dear little cottage down in the valley where he and Aglaia might live Aglaia had fallen in love with Glaucon just as he had with her But she never let him suspect it for ever so long He did not know how often she would steal up the mountain and hide behind the rocks near where the sheep pastured to listen to Glaucons beautiful music It was very lovely music because he was always thinking of Aglaia while he played though he little dreamed how near him she often was But after awhile Glaucon found out that Aglaia loved him and everything was well Nowadays I suppose a wealthy man like Aglaias father wouldnt be willing to let his daughter marry a hired man; but this was in the Golden Age you know when nothing like that mattered at all After that almost every day Aglaia would go up the mountain and sit beside Glaucon as he watched the flocks and played on his flute But he did not play as much as he used to because he liked better to talk with Aglaia And in the evening they would lead the sheep home together One day Aglaia went up the mountain by a new way and she came to a little brook Something was sparkling very brightly among its pebbles Aglaia picked it up and it was the most beautiful little stone that she had ever seen It was only as large as a pea but it glittered and flashed in the sunlight with every colour of the rainbow Aglaia was so delighted with it that she resolved to take it as a present to Glaucon But all at once she heard a stamping of hoofs behind her and when she turned she almost died from fright For there was the great god Pan and he was a very terrible object looking quite as much like a goat as a man The gods were not all beautiful you know And beautiful or not nobody ever wanted to meet them face to face Give that stone to me said Pan holding out his hand But Aglaia though she was frightened would not give him the stone I want it for Glaucon she said I want it for one of my wood nymphs said Pan and I must have it He advanced threateningly but Aglaia ran as hard as she could up the mountain If she could only reach Glaucon he would protect her Pan followed her clattering and bellowing terribly but in a few minutes she rushed into Glaucons arms The dreadful sight of Pan and the still more dreadful noise he made so frightened the sheep that they fled in all directions But Glaucon was not afraid at all because Pan was the god of shepherds and was bound to grant any prayer a good shepherd who always did his duty might make If Glaucon had NOT been a good shepherd dear knows what would have happened to him and Aglaia But he was; and when he begged Pan to go away and not frighten Aglaia any more Pan had to go grumbling a good deal--and Pans grumblings had a very ugly sound But still he WENT and that was the main thing Now dearest what is all this trouble about? asked Glaucon; and Aglaia told him the story But where is the beautiful stone? he asked when she had finished Didst thou drop it in thy alarm? No indeed! Aglaia had done nothing of the sort When she began to run she had popped it into her mouth and there it was still quite safe Now she poked it out between her red lips where it glittered in the sunlight Take it she whispered The question was--how was he to take it? Both of Aglaias arms were held fast to her sides by Glaucons arms; and if he loosened his clasp ever so little he was afraid she would fall so weak and trembling was she from her dreadful fright Then Glaucon had a brilliant idea He would take the beautiful stone from Aglaias lips with his own lips He bent over until his lips touched hers--and THEN he forgot all about the beautiful pebble and so did Aglaia Kissing was discovered! What a yarn! said Dan drawing a long breath when we had come to ourselves and discovered that we were really sitting in a dewy Prince Edward Island orchard instead of watching two lovers on a mountain in Thessaly in the Golden Age I dont believe a word of it Of course we know it wasnt really true said Felicity Well I dont know said the Story Girl thoughtfully I think there are two kinds of true things--true things that ARE and true things that are NOT but MIGHT be I dont believe theres any but the one kind of trueness said Felicity And anyway this story couldnt be true You know there was no such thing as a god Pan How do you know what there might have been in the Golden Age? asked the Story Girl Which was indeed an unanswerable question for Felicity I wonder what became of the beautiful stone? said Cecily Likely Aglaia swallowed it said Felix practically Did Glaucon and Aglaia ever get married? asked Sara Ray The story doesnt say It stops just there said the Story Girl But of course they did I will tell you what I think I dont think Aglaia swallowed the stone I think it just fell to the ground; and after awhile they found it and it turned out to be of such value that Glaucon could buy all the flocks and herds in the valley and the sweetest cottage; and he and Aglaia were married right away But you only THINK that said Sara Ray Id like to be really sure that was what happened Oh bother none of it happened said Dan I believed it while the Story Girl was telling it but I dont now Isnt that wheels? Wheels it was Two wagons were driving up the lane We rushed to the house--and there were Uncle Alec and Aunt Janet and Aunt Olivia! The excitement was quite tremendous Every body talked and laughed at once and it was not until we were all seated around the supper table that conversation grew coherent What laughter and questioning and telling of tales followed what smiles and bright eyes and glad voices And through it all the blissful purrs of Paddy who sat on the window sill behind the Story Girl resounded through the din like Andrew McPhersons bass-- just a bur-r-r-r the hale time Well Im thankful to be home again said Aunt Janet beaming on us We had a real nice time and Edwards folks were as kind as could be But give me home for a steady thing How has everything gone? How did the children behave Roger? Like models said Uncle Roger They were as good as gold most of the days There were times when one couldnt help liking Uncle Roger CHAPTER XIX A DREAD PROPHECY Ive got to go and begin stumping out the elderberry pasture this afternoon said Peter dolefully I tell you its a tough job Mr Roger might wait for cool weather before he sets people to stumping out elderberries and thats a fact Why dont you tell him so? asked Dan It aint my business to tell him things retorted Peter Im hired to do what Im told and I do it But I can have my own opinion all the same Its going to be a broiling hot day We were all in the orchard except Felix who had gone to the post-office It was the forenoon of an August Saturday Cecily and Sara Ray who had come up to spend the day with us--her mother having gone to town--were eating timothy roots Bertha Lawrence a Charlottetown girl who had visited Kitty Marr in June and had gone to school one day with her had eaten timothy roots affecting to consider them great delicacies The fad was at once taken up by the Carlisle schoolgirls Timothy roots quite ousted sours and young raspberry sprouts both of which had the real merit of being quite toothsome while timothy roots were tough and tasteless But timothy roots were fashionable therefore timothy roots must be eaten Pecks of them must have been devoured in Carlisle that summer Pat was there also padding about from one to the other on his black paws giving us friendly pokes and rubs We all made much of him except Felicity who would not take any notice of him because he was the Story Girls cat We boys were sprawling on the grass Our morning chores were done and the day was before us We should have been feeling very comfortable and happy but as a matter of fact we were not particularly so The Story Girl was sitting on the mint beside the well-house weaving herself a wreath of buttercups Felicity was sipping from the cup of clouded blue with an overdone air of unconcern Each was acutely and miserably conscious of the others presence and each was desirous of convincing the rest of us that the other was less than nothing to her Felicity could not succeed The Story Girl managed it better If it had not been for the fact that in all our foregatherings she was careful to sit as far from Felicity as possible we might have been deceived We had not passed a very pleasant week Felicity and the Story Girl had not been speaking to each other and consequently there had been something rotten in the state of Denmark An air of restraint was over all our games and conversations On the preceding Monday Felicity and the Story Girl had quarrelled over something What the cause of the quarrel was I cannot tell because I never knew It remained a dead secret between the parties of the first and second part forever But it was more bitter than the general run of their tiffs and the consequences were apparent to all They had not spoken to each other since This was not because the rancour of either lasted so long On the contrary it passed speedily away not even one low descending sun going down on their wrath But dignity remained to be considered Neither would speak first and each obstinately declared that she would not speak first no not in a hundred years Neither argument entreaty nor expostulation had any effect on those two stubborn girls nor yet the tears of sweet Cecily who cried every night about it and mingled in her pure little prayers fervent petitions that Felicity and the Story Girl might make up I dont know where you expect to go when you die Felicity she said tearfully if you dont forgive people I have forgiven her was Felicitys answer but I am not going to speak first for all that Its very wrong and more than that its so uncomfortable complained Cecily It spoils everything Were they ever like this before? I asked Cecily as we talked the matter over privately in Uncle Stephens Walk Never for so long said Cecily They had a spell like this last summer and one the summer before but they only lasted a couple of days And who spoke first? Oh the Story Girl She got excited about something and spoke to Felicity before she thought and then it was all right But Im afraid it isnt going to be like that this time Dont you notice how careful the Story Girl is not to get excited? That is such a bad sign Weve just got to think up something that will excite her thats all I said Im--Im praying about it said Cecily in a low voice her tear-wet lashes trembling against her pale round cheeks Do you suppose it will do any good Bev? Very likely I assured her Remember Sara Ray and the money That came from praying Im glad you think so said Cecily tremulously Dan said it was no use for me to bother praying about it He said if they COULDNT speak God might do something but when they just WOULDNT it wasnt likely He would interfere Dan does say such queer things Im so afraid hes going to grow up just like Uncle Robert Ward who never goes to church and doesnt believe more than half the Bible is true Which half does he believe is true? I inquired with unholy curiosity Oh just the nice parts He says theres a heaven all right but no--no--HELL I dont want Dan to grow up like that It isnt respectable And you wouldnt want all kinds of people crowding heaven now would you? Well no I suppose not I agreed thinking of Billy Robinson Of course I cant help feeling sorry for those who have to go to THE OTHER PLACE said Cecily compassionately But I suppose they wouldnt be very comfortable in heaven either They wouldnt feel at home Andrew Marr said a simply dreadful thing about THE OTHER PLACE one night last fall when Felicity and I were down to see Kitty and they were burning the potato stalks He said he believed THE OTHER PLACE must be lots more interesting than heaven because fires were such jolly things Now did you ever hear the like? I guess it depends a good deal on whether youre inside or outside the fires I said Oh Andrew didnt really mean it of course He just said it to sound smart and make us stare The Marrs are all like that But anyhow Im going to keep on praying that something will happen to excite the Story Girl I dont believe there is any use in praying that Felicity will speak first because I am sure she wont But dont you suppose God could make her? I said feeling that it wasnt quite fair that the Story Girl should always have to speak first If she had spoken first the other times it was surely Felicitys turn this time Well I believe it would puzzle Him said Cecily out of the depths of her experience with Felicity Peter as was to be expected took Felicitys part and said the Story Girl ought to speak first because she was the oldest That he said had always been his Aunt Janes rule Sara Ray thought Felicity should speak first because the Story Girl was half an orphan Felix tried to make peace between them and met the usual fate of all peacemakers The Story Girl loftily told him that he was too young to understand and Felicity said that fat boys should mind their own business After that Felix declared it would serve Felicity right if the Story Girl never spoke to her again Dan had no patience with either of the girls especially Felicity What they both want is a right good spanking he said If only a spanking would mend the matter it was not likely it would ever be mended Both Felicity and the Story Girl were rather too old to be spanked and if they had not been none of the grown-ups would have thought it worth while to administer so desperate a remedy for what they considered so insignificant a trouble With the usual levity of grown-ups they regarded the coldness between the girls as a subject of mirth and jest and recked not that it was freezing the genial current of our youthful souls and blighting hours that should have been fair pages in our book of days The Story Girl finished her wreath and put it on The buttercups drooped over her high white brow and played peep with her glowing eyes A dreamy smile hovered around her poppy-red mouth--a significant smile which to those of us skilled in its interpretation betokened the sentence which soon came I know a story about a man who always had his own opinion-- The Story Girl got no further We never heard the story of the man who always had his own opinion Felix came tearing up the lane with a newspaper in his hand When a boy as fat as Felix runs at full speed on a broiling August forenoon he has something to run for--as Felicity remarked He must have got some bad news at the office said Sara Ray Oh I hope nothing has happened to father I exclaimed springing anxiously to my feet a sick horrible feeling of fear running over me like a cool rippling wave Its just as likely to be good news he is running for as bad said the Story Girl who was no believer in meeting trouble half way He wouldnt be running so fast for good news said Dan cynically We were not left long in doubt The orchard gate flew open and Felix was among us One glimpse of his face told us that he was no bearer of glad tidings He had been running hard and should have been rubicund Instead he was as pale as are the dead I could not have asked him what was the matter had my life depended on it It was Felicity who demanded impatiently of my shaking voiceless brother Felix King what has scared you? Felix held out the newspaper--it was the Charlottetown _Daily Enterprise_ Its there he gasped Look--read--oh do you--think its--true? The--end of--the world--is coming to-morrow--at two--oclock--in the afternoon! Crash! Felicity had dropped the cup of clouded blue which had passed unscathed through so many changing years and now at last lay shattered on the stone of the well curb At any other time we should all have been aghast over such a catastrophe but it passed unnoticed now What mattered it that all the cups in the world be broken to-day if the crack o doom must sound to-morrow? Oh Sara Stanley do you believe it? DO you? gasped Felicity clutching the Story Girls hand Cecilys prayer had been answered Excitement had come with a vengeance and under its stress Felicity had spoken first But this like the breaking of the cup had no significance for us at the moment The Story Girl snatched the paper and read the announcement to a group on which sudden tense silence had fallen Under a sensational headline The Last Trump will sound at Two Oclock To-morrow was a paragraph to the effect that the leader of a certain noted sect in the United States had predicted that August twelfth would be the Judgment Day and that all his numerous followers were preparing for the dread event by prayer fasting and the making of appropriate white garments for ascension robes I laugh at the remembrance now--until I recall the real horror of fear that enwrapped us in that sunny orchard that August morning of long ago; and then I laugh no more We were only children be it remembered with a very firm and simple faith that grown people knew much more than we did and a rooted conviction that whatever you read in a newspaper must be true If the _Daily Enterprise_ said that August twelfth was to be the Judgment Day how were you going to get around it? Do you believe it Sara Stanley? persisted Felicity DO you? No--no I dont believe a word of it said the Story Girl But for once her voice failed to carry conviction--or rather it carried conviction of the very opposite kind It was borne in upon our miserable minds that if the Story Girl did not altogether believe it was true she believed it might be true; and the possibility was almost as dreadful as the certainty It CANT be true said Sara Ray seeking refuge as usual in tears Why everything looks just the same Things COULDNT look the same if the Judgment Day was going to be to-morrow But thats just the way its to come I said uncomfortably It tells you in the Bible Its to come just like a thief in the night But it tells you another thing in the Bible too said Cecily eagerly It says nobody knows when the Judgment Day is to come--not even the angels in heaven Now if the angels in heaven dont know it do you suppose the editor of the _Enterprise_ can know it--and him a Grit too? I guess he knows as much about it as a Tory would retorted the Story Girl Uncle Roger was a Liberal and Uncle Alec a Conservative and the girls held fast to the political traditions of their respective households But it isnt really the _Enterprise_ editor at all who is saying it--its a man in the States who claims to be a prophet If he IS a prophet perhaps he has found out somehow And its in the paper too and thats printed as well as the Bible said Dan Well Im going to depend on the Bible said Cecily I dont believe its the Judgment Day to-morrow--but Im scared for all that she added piteously That was exactly the position of us all As in the case of the bell-ringing ghost we did not believe but we trembled Nobody might have known when the Bible was written said Dan but maybe somebody knows now Why the Bible was written thousands of years ago and that paper was printed this very morning Theres been time to find out ever so much more I want to do so many things said the Story Girl plucking off her crown of buttercup gold with a tragic gesture but if its the Judgment Day to-morrow I wont have time to do any of them It cant be much worse than dying I spose said Felix grasping at any straw of comfort Im awful glad Ive got into the habit of going to church and Sunday School this summer said Peter very soberly I wish Id made up my mind before this whether to be a Presbyterian or a Methodist Do you spose its too late now? Oh that doesnt matter said Cecily earnestly If--if youre a Christian Peter that is all thats necessary But its too late for that said Peter miserably I cant turn into a Christian between this and two oclock to-morrow Ill just have to be satisfied with making up my mind to be a Presbyterian or a Methodist I wanted to wait till I got old enough to make out what was the difference between them but Ill have to chance it now I guess Ill be a Presbyterian cause I want to be like the rest of you Yes Ill be a Presbyterian I know a story about Judy Pineau and the word Presbyterian said the Story Girl but I cant tell it now If to-morrow isnt the Judgment Day Ill tell it Monday If I had known that to-morrow might be the Judgment Day I wouldnt have quarrelled with you last Monday Sara Stanley or been so horrid and sulky all the week Indeed I wouldnt said Felicity with very unusual humility Ah Felicity! We were all in the depths of our pitiful little souls reviewing the innumerable things we would or would not have done if we had known What a black and endless list they made--those sins of omission and commission that rushed accusingly across our young memories! For us the leaves of the Book of Judgment were already opened; and we stood at the bar of our own consciences than which for youth or eld there can be no more dread tribunal I thought of all the evil deeds of my short life--of pinching Felix to make him cry out at family prayers of playing truant from Sunday School and going fishing one day of a certain fib--no no away from this awful hour with all such euphonious evasions--of a LIE I had once told of many a selfish and unkind word and thought and action And to-morrow might be the great and terrible day of the last accounting! Oh if I had only been a better boy! The quarrel was as much my fault as yours Felicity said the Story Girl putting her arm around Felicity We cant undo it now But if to-morrow isnt the Judgment Day we must be careful never to quarrel again Oh I wish father was here He will be said Cecily If its the Judgment Day for Prince Edward Island it will be for Europe too I wish we could just KNOW whether what the paper says is true or not said Felix desperately It seems to me I could brace up if I just KNEW But to whom could we appeal? Uncle Alec was away and would not be back until late that night Neither Aunt Janet nor Uncle Roger were people to whom we cared to apply in such a crisis We were afraid of the Judgment Day; but we were almost equally afraid of being laughed at How about Aunt Olivia? No Aunt Olivia has gone to bed with a sick headache and mustnt be disturbed said the Story Girl She said I must get dinner ready because there was plenty of cold meat and nothing to do but boil the potatoes and peas and set the table I dont know how I can put my thoughts into it when the Judgment Day may be to-morrow Besides what is the good of asking the grown-ups? They dont know anything more about this than we do But if theyd just SAY they didnt believe it it would be a sort of comfort said Cecily I suppose the minister would know but hes away on his vacation said Felicity Anyhow Ill go and ask mother what she thinks of it Felicity picked up the _Enterprise_ and betook herself to the house We awaited her return in dire suspense Well what does she say? asked Cecily tremulously She said Run away and dont bother me I havent any time for your nonsense responded Felicity in an injured tone And I said But ma the paper SAYS to-morrow is the Judgment Day and ma just said Judgment Fiddlesticks! Well thats kind of comforting said Peter She cant put any faith in it or shed be more worked up If it only wasnt PRINTED! said Dan gloomily Lets all go over and ask Uncle Roger said Felix desperately That we should make Uncle Roger a court of last resort indicated all too clearly the state of our minds But we went Uncle Roger was in his barn-yard hitching his black mare into the buggy His copy of the _Enterprise_ was sticking out of his pocket He looked as we saw with sinking hearts unusually grave and preoccupied There was not a glimmer of a smile about his face You ask him said Felicity nudging the Story Girl Uncle Roger said the Story Girl the golden notes of her voice threaded with fear and appeal the _Enterprise_ says that to-morrow is the Judgment Day? IS it? Do YOU think it is? Im afraid so said Uncle Roger gravely The _Enterprise_ is always very careful to print only reliable news But mother doesnt believe it cried Felicity Uncle Roger shook his head That is just the trouble he said People wont believe it till its too late Im going straight to Markdale to pay a man there some money I owe him and after dinner Im going to Summerside to buy me a new suit My old one is too shabby for the Judgment Day He got into his buggy and drove away leaving eight distracted mortals behind him Well I suppose that settles it said Peter in despairing tone Is there anything we can do to PREPARE? asked Cecily I wish I had a white dress like you girls sobbed Sara Ray But I havent and its too late to get one Oh I wish I had minded what ma said better I wouldnt have disobeyed her so often if Id thought the Judgment Day was so near When I go home Im going to tell her about going to the magic lantern show Im not sure that Uncle Roger meant what he said remarked the Story Girl I couldnt get a look into his eyes If he was trying to hoax us there would have been a twinkle in them He can never help that You know he would think it a great joke to frighten us like this Its really dreadful to have no grown-ups you can depend on We could depend on father if he was here said Dan stoutly HED tell us the truth He would tell us what he THOUGHT was true Dan but he couldnt KNOW Hes not such a well-educated man as the editor of the _Enterprise_ No theres nothing to do but wait and see Let us go into the house and read just what the Bible does say about it suggested Cecily We crept in carefully lest we disturb Aunt Olivia and Cecily found and read the significant portion of Holy Writ There was little comfort for us in that vivid and terrible picture Well said the Story Girl finally I must go and get the potatoes ready I suppose they must be boiled even if it is the Judgment Day to-morrow But I dont believe it is And Ive got to go and stump elderberries said Peter I dont see how I can do it--go away back there alone Ill feel scared to death the whole time Tell Uncle Roger that and say if to-morrow is the end of the world that there is no good in stumping any more fields I suggested Yes and if he lets you off then well know he was in earnest chimed in Cecily But if he still says you must go thatll be a sign he doesnt believe it Leaving the Story Girl and Peter to peel their potatoes the rest of us went home where Aunt Janet who had gone to the well and found the fragments of the old blue cup gave poor Felicity a bitter scolding about it But Felicity bore it very patiently--nay more she seemed to delight in it Ma cant believe to-morrow is the last day or she wouldnt scold like that she told us; and this comforted us until after dinner when the Story Girl and Peter came over and told us that Uncle Roger had really gone to Summerside Then we plunged down into fear and wretchedness again But he said I must go and stump elderberries just the same said Peter He said it might NOT be the Judgment Day to-morrow though he believed it was and it would keep me out of mischief But I just cant stand it back there alone Some of you fellows must come with me I dont want you to work but just for company It was finally decided that Dan and Felix should go I wanted to go also but the girls protested YOU must stay and keep us cheered up implored Felicity I just dont know how Im ever going to put in the afternoon I promised Kitty Marr that Id go down and spend it with her but I cant now And I cant knit any at my lace Id just keep thinking What is the use? Perhaps itll all be burned up to-morrow So I stayed with the girls and a miserable afternoon we had of it The Story Girl again and again declared that she didnt believe it but when we asked her to tell a story she evaded it with a flimsy excuse Cecily pestered Aunt Janets life out asking repeatedly Ma will you be washing Monday? Ma will you be going to prayer meeting Tuesday night? Ma will you be preserving raspberries next week? and various similar questions It was a huge comfort to her that Aunt Janet always said Yes or Of course as if there could be no question about it Sara Ray cried until I wondered how one small head could contain all the tears she shed But I do not believe she was half as much frightened as disappointed that she had no white dress In mid-afternoon Cecily came downstairs with her forget-me-not jug in her hand--a dainty bit of china wreathed with dark blue forget-me-nots which Cecily prized highly and in which she always kept her toothbrush Sara I am going to give you this jug she said solemnly Now Sara had always coveted this particular jug She stopped crying long enough to clutch it delightedly Oh Cecily thank you But are you sure you wont want it back if to-morrow isnt the Judgment Day? No its yours for good said Cecily with the high remote air of one to whom forget-me-not jugs and all such pomps and vanities of the world were as a tale that is told Are you going to give any one your cherry vase? asked Felicity trying to speak indifferently Felicity had never admired the forget-me-not jug but she had always hankered after the cherry vase--an affair of white glass with a cluster of red glass cherries and golden-green glass leaves on its side which Aunt Olivia had given Cecily one Christmas No Im not answered Cecily with a change of tone Oh well I dont care said Felicity quickly Only if to-morrow is the last day the cherry vase wont be much use to you I guess it will be as much use to me as to any one else said Cecily indignantly She had sacrificed her dear forget-me-not jug to satisfy some pang of conscience or propitiate some threatening fate but surrender her precious cherry vase she could not and would not Felicity neednt be giving any hints! With the gathering shades of night our plight became pitiful In the daylight surrounded by homely familiar sights and sounds it was not so difficult to fortify our souls with a cheering incredulity But now in this time of shadows dread belief clutched us and wrung us with terror If there had been one wise older friend to tell us in serious fashion that we need not be afraid that the _Enterprise_ paragraph was naught save the idle report of a deluded fanatic it would have been well for us But there was not Our grown-ups instead considered our terror an exquisite jest At that very moment Aunt Olivia who had recovered from her headache and Aunt Janet were laughing in the kitchen over the state the children were in because they were afraid the end of the world was close at hand Aunt Janets throaty gurgle and Aunt Olivias trilling mirth floated out through the open window Perhaps theyll laugh on the other side of their faces to-morrow said Dan with gloomy satisfaction We were sitting on the cellar hatch watching what might be our last sunset oer the dark hills of time Peter was with us It was his last Sunday to go home but he had elected to remain If to-morrow is the Judgment Day I want to be with you fellows he said Sara Ray had also yearned to stay but could not because her mother had told her she must be home before dark Never mind Sara comforted Cecily Its not to be till two oclock to-morrow so youll have plenty of time to get up here before anything happens But there might be a mistake sobbed Sara It might be two oclock to-night instead of to-morrow It might indeed This was a new horror which had not occurred to us Im sure I wont sleep a wink to-night said Felix The paper SAYS two oclock to-morrow said Dan You neednt worry Sara But Sara departed weeping She did not however forget to carry the forget-me-not jug with her All things considered her departure was a relief Such a constantly tearful damsel was not a pleasant companion Cecily and Felicity and the Story Girl did not cry They were made of finer firmer stuff Dry-eyed with such courage as they might they faced whatever might be in store for them I wonder where well all be this time to-morrow night said Felix mournfully as we watched the sunset between the dark fir boughs It was an ominous sunset The sun dropped down amid dark livid clouds that turned sullen shades of purple and fiery red behind him I hope well be all together wherever we are said Cecily gently Nothing can be so very bad then Im going to read the Bible all to-morrow forenoon said Peter When Aunt Olivia came out to go home the Story Girl asked her permission to stay all night with Felicity and Cecily Aunt Olivia assented lightly swinging her hat on her arm and including us all in a friendly smile She looked very pretty with her big blue eyes and warm-hued golden hair We loved Aunt Olivia; but just now we resented her having laughed at us with Aunt Janet and we refused to smile back What a sulky sulky lot of little people said Aunt Olivia going away across the yard holding her pretty dress up from the dewy grass Peter resolved to stay all night with us too not troubling himself about anybodys permission When we went to bed it was settling down for a stormy night and the rain was streaming wetly on the roof as if the world like Sara Ray were weeping because its end was so near Nobody forgot or hurried over his prayers that night We would dearly have loved to leave the candle burning but Aunt Janets decree regarding this was as inexorable as any of Mede and Persia Out the candle must go; and we lay there quaking with the wild rain streaming down on the roof above us and the voices of the storm wailing through the writhing spruce trees CHAPTER XX THE JUDGMENT SUNDAY Sunday morning broke dull and gray The rain had ceased but the clouds hung dark and brooding above a world which in its windless calm following the spent storm-throe seemed to us to be waiting till judgment spoke the doom of fate We were all up early None of us it appeared had slept well and some of us not at all The Story Girl had been among the latter and she looked very pale and wan with black shadows under her deep-set eyes Peter however had slept soundly enough after twelve oclock When youve been stumping out elderberries all the afternoon itll take more than the Judgment Day to keep you awake all night he said But when I woke up this morning it was just awful Id forgot it for a moment and then it all came back with a rush and I was worse scared than before Cecily was pale but brave For the first time in years she had not put her hair up in curlers on Saturday night It was brushed and braided with Puritan simplicity If its the Judgment Day I dont care whether my hair is curly or not she said Well said Aunt Janet when we all descended to the kitchen this is the first time you young ones have ever all got up without being called and thats a fact At breakfast our appetites were poor How could the grown-ups eat as they did? After breakfast and the necessary chores there was the forenoon to be lived through Peter true to his word got out his Bible and began to read from the first chapter in Genesis I wont have time to read it all through I spose he said but Ill get along as far as I can There was no preaching in Carlisle that day and Sunday School was not till the evening Cecily got out her Lesson Slip and studied the lesson conscientiously The rest of us did not see how she could do it We could not that was very certain If it isnt the Judgment Day I want to have the lesson learned she said and if it is Ill feel Ive done what was right But I never found it so hard to remember the Golden Text before The long dragging hours were hard to endure We roamed restlessly about and went to and fro--all save Peter who still steadily read away at his Bible He was through Genesis by eleven and beginning on Exodus Theres a good deal of it I dont understand he said but I read every word and thats the main thing That story about Joseph and his brother was so intresting I almost forgot about the Judgment Day But the long drawn out dread was beginning to get on Dans nerves If it is the Judgment Day he growled as we went in to dinner I wish itd hurry up and have it over Oh Dan! cried Felicity and Cecily together in a chorus of horror But the Story Girl looked as if she rather sympathized with Dan If we had eaten little at breakfast we could eat still less at dinner After dinner the clouds rolled away and the sun came joyously and gloriously out This we thought was a good omen Felicity opined that it wouldnt have cleared up if it was the Judgment Day Nevertheless we dressed ourselves carefully and the girls put on their white dresses Sara Ray came up still crying of course She increased our uneasiness by saying that her mother believed the _Enterprise_ paragraph and was afraid that the end of the world was really at hand Thats why she let me come up she sobbed If she hadnt been afraid I dont believe she would have let me come up But Id have died if I couldnt have come And she wasnt a bit cross when I told her I had gone to the magic lantern show Thats an awful bad sign I hadnt a white dress but I put on my white muslin apron with the frills That seems kind of queer said Felicity doubtfully You wouldnt put on an apron to go to church and so it doesnt seem as if it was proper to put it on for Judgment Day either Well its the best I could do said Sara disconsolately I wanted to have something white on Its just like a dress only it hasnt sleeves Lets go into the orchard and wait said the Story Girl Its one oclock now so in another hour well know the worst Well leave the front door open and well hear the big clock when it strikes two No better plan being suggested we betook ourselves to the orchard and sat on the boughs of Uncle Alecs tree because the grass was wet The world was beautiful and peaceful and green Overhead was a dazzling blue sky spotted with heaps of white cloud Pshaw I dont believe theres any fear of it being the last day said Dan beginning a whistle out of sheer bravado Well dont whistle on Sunday anyhow said Felicity severely I dont see a thing about Methodists or Presbyterians as far as Ive gone and Im most through Exodus said Peter suddenly When does it begin to tell about them? Theres nothing about Methodists or Presbyterians in the Bible said Felicity scornfully Peter looked amazed Well how did they happen then? he asked When did they begin to be? Ive often thought it such a strange thing that there isnt a word about either of them in the Bible said Cecily Especially when it mentions Baptists--or at least one Baptist Well anyhow said Peter even if it isnt the Judgment Day Im going to keep on reading the Bible until Ive got clean through I never thought it was such an intresting book It sounds simply dreadful to hear you call the Bible an interesting book said Felicity with a shudder at the sacrilege Why you might be talking about ANY common book I didnt mean any harm said Peter crestfallen The Bible IS an interesting book said the Story Girl coming to Peters rescue And there are magnificent stories in it--yes Felicity MAGNIFICENT If the world doesnt come to an end Ill tell you the story of Ruth next Sunday--or look here! Ill tell it anyhow Thats a promise Wherever we are next Sunday Ill tell you about Ruth Why you wouldnt tell stories in heaven said Cecily in a very timid voice Why not? said the Story Girl with a flash of her eyes Indeed I shall Ill tell stories as long as Ive a tongue to talk with or any one to listen Ay doubtless That dauntless spirit would soar triumphantly above the wreck of matter and the crash of worlds taking with it all its own wild sweetness and daring Even the young-eyed cherubim choiring on meadows of asphodel might cease their harping for a time to listen to a tale of the vanished earth told by that golden tongue Some vague thought of this was in our minds as we looked at her; and somehow it comforted us Not even the Judgment was so greatly to be feared if after it we were the SAME our own precious little identities unchanged It must be getting handy two said Cecily It seems as if wed been waiting here for ever so much longer than an hour Conversation languished We watched and waited nervously The moments dragged by each seeming an hour Would two oclock never come and end the suspense? We all became very tense Even Peter had to stop reading Any unaccustomed sound or sight in the world about us struck on our taut senses like the trump of doom A cloud passed over the sun and as the sudden shadow swept across the orchard we turned pale and trembled A wagon rumbling over a plank bridge in the hollow made Sara Ray start up with a shriek The slamming of a barn door over at Uncle Rogers caused the cold perspiration to break out on our faces I dont believe its the Judgment Day said Felix and I never have believed it But oh I wish that clock would strike two Cant you tell us a story to pass the time? I entreated the Story Girl She shook her head No it would be no use to try But if this isnt the Judgment Day Ill have a great one to tell of us being so scared Pat presently came galloping up the orchard carrying in his mouth a big field mouse which sitting down before us he proceeded to devour body and bones afterwards licking his chops with great satisfaction It cant be the Judgment Day said Sara Ray brightening up Paddy would never be eating mice if it was If that clock doesnt soon strike two I shall go out of my seven senses declared Cecily with unusual vehemence Time always seems long when youre waiting said the Story Girl But it does seem as if we had been here more than an hour Maybe the clock struck and we didnt hear it suggested Dan Somebodyd better go and see Ill go said Cecily I suppose even if anything happens Ill have time to get back to you We watched her white-clad figure pass through the gate and enter the front door A few minutes passed--or a few years--we could not have told which Then Cecily came running at full speed back to us But when she reached us she trembled so much that at first she could not speak What is it? Is it past two? implored the Story Girl Its--its four said Cecily with a gasp The old clock isnt going Mother forgot to wind it up last night and it stopped But its four by the kitchen clock--so it isnt the Judgment Day--and tea is ready--and mother says to come in We looked at each other realizing what our dread had been now that it was lifted It was not the Judgment Day The world and life were still before us with all their potent lure of years unknown Ill never believe anything I read in the papers again said Dan rushing to the opposite extreme I told you the Bible was more to be depended on than the newspapers said Cecily triumphantly Sara Ray and Peter and the Story Girl went home and we went in to tea with royal appetites Afterwards as we dressed for Sunday School upstairs our spirits carried us away to such an extent that Aunt Janet had to come twice to the foot of the stairs and inquire severely Children have you forgotten what day this is? Isnt it nice that were going to live a spell longer in this nice world? said Felix as we walked down the hill Yes and Felicity and the Story Girl are speaking again said Cecily happily And Felicity DID speak first I said Yes but it took the Judgment Day to make her I wish added Cecily with a sigh that I hadnt been in quite such a hurry giving away my forget-me-not jug And I wish I hadnt been in such a hurry deciding Id be a Presbyterian said Peter Well its not too late for that said Dan You can change your mind now No sir said Peter with a flash of spirit I aint one of the kind that says theyll be something just because theyre scared and when the scare is over go back on it I said Id be Presbyterian and I mean to stick to it You said you knew a story that had something to do with Presbyterians I said to the Story Girl Tell us it now Oh no it isnt the right kind of story to tell on Sunday she replied But Ill tell it to-morrow morning Accordingly we heard it the next morning in the orchard Long ago when Judy Pineau was young said the Story Girl she was hired with Mrs Elder Frewen--the first Mrs Elder Frewen Mrs Frewen had been a school-teacher and she was very particular as to how people talked and the grammar they used And she didnt like anything but refined words One very hot day she heard Judy Pineau say she was all in a sweat Mrs Frewen was greatly shocked and said Judy you shouldnt say that Its horses that sweat You should say you are in a perspiration Well Judy promised shed remember because she liked Mrs Frewen and was anxious to please her Not long afterwards Judy was scrubbing the kitchen floor one morning and when Mrs Frewen came in Judy looked up and said quite proud over using the right word Oh Mees Frewen aint it awful hot? I declare Im all in a Presbyterian CHAPTER XXI DREAMERS OF DREAMS August went out and September came in Harvest was ended; and though summer was not yet gone her face was turned westering The asters lettered her retreating footsteps in a purple script and over the hills and valleys hung a faint blue smoke as if Nature were worshipping at her woodland altar The apples began to burn red on the bending boughs; crickets sang day and night; squirrels chattered secrets of Polichinelle in the spruces; the sunshine was as thick and yellow as molten gold; school opened and we small denizens of the hill farms lived happy days of harmless work and necessary play closing in nights of peaceful undisturbed slumber under a roof watched over by autumnal stars At least our slumbers were peaceful and undisturbed until our orgy of dreaming began I would really like to know what especial kind of deviltry you young fry are up to this time said Uncle Roger one evening as he passed through the orchard with his gun on his shoulder bound for the swamp We were sitting in a circle before the Pulpit Stone each writing diligently in an exercise book and eating the Rev Mr Scotts plums which always reached their prime of juicy golden-green flesh and bloomy blue skin in September The Rev Mr Scott was dead and gone but those plums certainly kept his memory green as his forgotten sermons could never have done Oh said Felicity in a shocked tone when Uncle Roger had passed by Uncle Roger SWORE Oh no he didnt said the Story Girl quickly Deviltry isnt swearing at all It only means extra bad mischief Well its not a very nice word anyhow said Felicity No it isnt agreed the Story Girl with a regretful sigh Its very expressive but it isnt nice That is the way with so many words Theyre expressive but theyre not nice and so a girl cant use them The Story Girl sighed again She loved expressive words and treasured them as some girls might have treasured jewels To her they were as lustrous pearls threaded on the crimson cord of a vivid fancy When she met with a new one she uttered it over and over to herself in solitude weighing it caressing it infusing it with the radiance of her voice making it her own in all its possibilities for ever Well anyhow it isnt a suitable word in this case insisted Felicity We are not up to any dev--any extra bad mischief Writing down ones dreams isnt mischief at all Certainly it wasnt Surely not even the straitest sect of the grown-ups could call it so If writing down your dreams with agonizing care as to composition and spelling--for who knew that the eyes of generations unborn might not read the record?--were not a harmless amusement could anything be called so? I trow not We had been at it for a fortnight and during that time we only lived to have dreams and write them down The Story Girl had originated the idea one evening in the rustling rain-wet ways of the spruce wood where we were picking gum after a day of showers When we had picked enough we sat down on the moss-grown stones at the end of a long arcade where it opened out on the harvest-golden valley below us our jaws exercising themselves vigorously on the spoil of our climbings We were never allowed to chew gum in school or in company but in wood and field orchard and hayloft such rules were in abeyance My Aunt Jane used to say it wasnt polite to chew gum anywhere said Peter rather ruefully I dont suppose your Aunt Jane knew all the rules of etiquette said Felicity designing to crush Peter with a big word borrowed from the _Family Guide_ But Peter was not to be so crushed He had in him a certain toughness of fibre that would have been proof against a whole dictionary She did too he retorted My Aunt Jane was a real lady even if she was only a Craig She knew all those rules and she kept them when there was nobody round to see her just the same as when any one was And she was smart If father had had half her git-up-and-git I wouldnt be a hired boy to-day Have you any idea where your father is? asked Dan No said Peter indifferently The last we heard of him he was in the Maine lumber woods But that was three years ago I dont know where he is now and added Peter deliberately taking his gum from his mouth to make his statement more impressive I dont care Oh Peter that sounds dreadful said Cecily Your own father! Well said Peter defiantly if your own father had run away when you was a baby and left your mother to earn her living by washing and working out I guess you wouldnt care much about him either Perhaps your father may come home some of these days with a huge fortune suggested the Story Girl Perhaps pigs may whistle but theyve poor mouths for it was all the answer Peter deigned to this charming suggestion There goes Mr Campbell down the road said Dan Thats his new mare Isnt she a dandy? Shes got a skin like black satin He calls her Betty Sherman I dont think its very nice to call a horse after your own grandmother said Felicity Betty Sherman would have thought it a compliment said the Story Girl Maybe she would She couldnt have been very nice herself or she would never have gone and asked a man to marry her said Felicity Why not? Goodness me it was dreadful! Would YOU do such a thing yourself? Well I dont know said the Story Girl her eyes gleaming with impish laughter If I wanted him DREADFULLY and HE wouldnt do the asking perhaps I would Id rather die an old maid forty times over exclaimed Felicity Nobody as pretty as you will ever be an old maid Felicity said Peter who never put too fine an edge on his compliments Felicity tossed her golden tressed head and tried to look angry but made a dismal failure of it It wouldnt be ladylike to ask any one to marry you you know argued Cecily I dont suppose the _Family Guide_ would think so agreed the Story Girl lazily with some sarcasm in her voice The Story Girl never held the _Family Guide_ in such reverence as did Felicity and Cecily They pored over the etiquette column every week and could have told you on demand just exactly what kind of gloves should be worn at a wedding what you should say when introducing or being introduced and how you ought to look when your best young man came to see you They say Mrs Richard Cook asked HER husband to marry her said Dan Uncle Roger says she didnt exactly ask him but she helped the lame dog over the stile so slick that Richard was engaged to her before he knew what had happened to him said the Story Girl I know a story about Mrs Richard Cooks grandmother She was one of those women who are always saying I told you so-- Take notice Felicity said Dan aside --And she was very stubborn Soon after she was married she and her husband quarrelled about an apple tree they had planted in their orchard The label was lost He said it was a Fameuse and she declared it was a Yellow Transparent They fought over it till the neighbours came out to listen Finally he got so angry that he told her to shut up They didnt have any _Family Guide_ in those days so he didnt know it wasnt polite to say shut up to your wife I suppose she thought she would teach him manners for would you believe it? That woman did shut up and never spoke one single word to her husband for five years And then in five years time the tree bore apples and they WERE Yellow Transparents And then she spoke at last She said I told you so And did she talk to him after that as usual? asked Sara Ray Oh yes she was just the same as she used to be said the Story Girl wearily But that doesnt belong to the story It stops when she spoke at last Youre never satisfied to leave a story where it should stop Sara Ray Well I always like to know what happens afterwards said Sara Ray Uncle Roger says he wouldnt want a wife he could never quarrel with remarked Dan He says it would be too tame a life for him I wonder if Uncle Roger will always stay a bachelor said Cecily He seems real happy observed Peter Ma says that its all right as long as he is a bachelor because he wont take any one said Felicity but if he wakes up some day and finds he is an old bachelor because he cant get any one itll have a very different flavour If your Aunt Olivia was to up and get married what would your Uncle Roger do for a housekeeper? asked Peter Oh but Aunt Olivia will never be married now said Felicity Why shell be twenty-nine next January Well o course thats pretty old admitted Peter but she might find some one who wouldnt mind that seeing shes so pretty It would be awful splendid and exciting to have a wedding in the family wouldnt it? said Cecily Ive never seen any one married and Id just love to Ive been to four funerals but not to one single wedding Ive never even got to a funeral said Sara Ray gloomily Theres the wedding veil of the proud princess said Cecily pointing to a long drift of filmy vapour in the southwestern sky And look at that sweet pink cloud below it added Felicity Maybe that little pink cloud is a dream getting all ready to float down into somebodys sleep suggested the Story Girl I had a perfectly awful dream last night said Cecily with a shudder of remembrance I dreamed I was on a desert island inhabited by tigers and natives with two heads Oh! the Story Girl looked at Cecily half reproachfully Why couldnt you tell it better than that? If I had such a dream I could tell it so that everybody else would feel as if they had dreamed it too Well Im not you countered Cecily and I wouldnt want to frighten any one as I was frightened It was an awful dream--but it was kind of interesting too Ive had some real intresting dreams said Peter but I cant remember them long I wish I could Why dont you write them down? suggested the Story Girl Oh-- she turned upon us a face illuminated with a sudden inspiration Ive an idea Let us each get an exercise book and write down all our dreams just as we dream them Well see wholl have the most interesting collection And well have them to read and laugh over when were old and gray Instantly we all saw ourselves and each other by inner vision old and gray--all but the Story Girl We could not picture her as old Always as long as she lived so it seemed to us must she have sleek brown curls a voice like the sound of a harpstring in the wind and eyes that were stars of eternal youth CHAPTER XXII THE DREAM BOOKS The next day the Story Girl coaxed Uncle Roger to take her to Markdale and there she bought our dream books They were ten cents apiece with ruled pages and mottled green covers My own lies open beside me as I write its yellowed pages inscribed with the visions that haunted my childish slumbers on those nights of long ago On the cover is pasted a ladys visiting card on which is written The Dream Book of Beverley King Cecily had a packet of visiting cards which she was hoarding against the day when she would be grown up and could put the calling etiquette of the _Family Guide_ into practice; but she generously gave us all one apiece for the covers of our dream books As I turn the pages and glance over the (----) records each one beginning Last night I dreamed the past comes very vividly back to me I see that bowery orchard shining in memory with a soft glow of beauty-- the light that never was on land or sea --where we sat on those September evenings and wrote down our dreams when the cares of the day were over and there was nothing to interfere with the pleasing throes of composition Peter--Dan--Felix--Cecily--Felicity--Sara Ray--the Story Girl--they are all around me once more in the sweet-scented fading grasses each with open dream books and pencil in hand now writing busily now staring fixedly into space in search of some elusive word or phrase which might best describe the indescribable I hear their laughing voices I see their bright unclouded eyes In this little old book filled with cramped boyish writing there is a spell of white magic that sets the years at naught Beverley King is a boy once more writing down his dreams in the old King orchard on the homestead hill blown over by musky winds Opposite to him sits the Story Girl with her scarlet rosetted head her beautiful bare feet crossed before her one slender hand propping her high white brow on either side of which fall her glossy curls There to the right is sweet Cecily of the dear brown eyes with a little bloated dictionary beside her--for you dream of so many things you cant spell or be expected to spell when you are only eleven Next to her sits Felicity beautiful and conscious that she is beautiful with hair of spun sunshine and sea-blue eyes and all the roses of that vanished summer abloom in her cheeks Peter is beside her of course sprawled flat on his stomach among the grasses one hand clutching his black curls with his dream book on a small round stone before him--for only so can Peter compose at all and even then he finds it hard work He can handle a hoe more deftly than a pencil and his spelling even with all his frequent appeals to Cecily is a fearful and wonderful thing As for punctuation he never attempts it beyond an occasion period jotted down whenever he happens to think of it whether in the right place or not The Story Girl goes over his dreams after he has written them out and puts in the commas and semicolons and straightens out the sentences Felix sits on the right of the Story Girl fat and stodgy grimly in earnest even over dreams He writes with his knees stuck up to form a writing-desk and he always frowns fiercely the whole time Dan like Peter writes lying down flat but with his back towards us; and he has a dismal habit of groaning aloud writhing his whole body and digging his toes into the grass when he cannot turn a sentence to suit him Sara Ray is at his left There is seldom anything to be said of Sara except to tell where she is Like Tennysons Maud in one respect at least Sara is splendidly null Well there we sit and write in our dream books and Uncle Roger passes by and accuses us of being up to dev--to very bad mischief Each of us was very anxious to possess the most exciting record; but we were an honourable little crew and I do not think anything was ever written down in those dream books which had not really been dreamed We had expected that the Story Girl would eclipse us all in the matter of dreams; but at least in the beginning her dreams were no more remarkable than those of the rest of us In dreamland we were all equal Cecily indeed seemed to have the most decided talent for dramatic dreams That meekest and mildest of girls was in the habit of dreaming truly terrible things Almost every night battle murder or sudden death played some part in her visions On the other hand Dan who was a somewhat truculent fellow addicted to the perusal of lurid dime novels which he borrowed from the other boys in school dreamed dreams of such a peaceful and pastoral character that he was quite disgusted with the resulting tame pages of his dream book But if the Story Girl could not dream anything more wonderful than the rest of us she scored when it came to the telling To hear her tell a dream was as good--or as bad--as dreaming it yourself As far as writing them down was concerned I believe that I Beverley King carried off the palm I was considered to possess a pretty knack of composition But the Story Girl went me one better even there because having inherited something of her fathers talent for drawing she illustrated her dreams with sketches that certainly caught the spirit of them whatever might be said of their technical excellence She had an especial knack for drawing monstrosities; and I vividly recall the picture of an enormous and hideous lizard looking like a reptile of the pterodactyl period which she had dreamed of seeing crawl across the roof of the house On another occasion she had a frightful dream--at least it seemed frightful while she told us and described the dreadful feeling it had given her--of being chased around the parlour by the ottoman which made faces at her She drew a picture of the grimacing ottoman on the margin of her dream book which so scared Sara Ray when she beheld it that she cried all the way home and insisted on sleeping that night with Judy Pineau lest the furniture take to pursuing her also Sara Rays own dreams never amounted to much She was always in trouble of some sort--couldnt get her hair braided or her shoes on the right feet Consequently her dream book was very monotonous The only thing worth mentioning in the way of dreams that Sara Ray ever achieved was when she dreamed that she went up in a balloon and fell out I expected to come down with an awful thud she said shuddering but I lit as light as a feather and woke right up If you hadnt woke up youd have died said Peter with a dark significance If you dream of falling and DONT wake you DO land with a thud and it kills you Thats what happens to people who die in their sleep How do you know? asked Dan skeptically Nobody who died in his sleep could ever tell it My Aunt Jane told me so said Peter I suppose that settles it said Felicity disagreeably You always say something nasty when I mention my Aunt Jane said Peter reproachfully What did I say that was nasty? cried Felicity I didnt say a single thing Well it sounded nasty said Peter who knew that it is the tone that makes the music What did your Aunt Jane look like? asked Cecily sympathetically Was she pretty? No conceded Peter reluctantly she wasnt pretty--but she looked like the woman in that picture the Story Girls father sent her last week--the one with the shiny ring round her head and the baby in her lap Ive seen Aunt Jane look at me just like that woman looks at her baby Ma never looks so Poor ma is too busy washing I wish I could dream of my Aunt Jane I never do Dream of the dead youll hear of the living quoted Felix oracularly I dreamed last night that I threw a lighted match into that keg of gunpowder in Mr Cooks store at Markdale said Peter It blew up--and everything blew up--and they fished me out of the mess--but I woke up before Id time to find out if I was killed or not One is so apt to wake up just as things get interesting remarked the Story Girl discontentedly I dreamed last night that I had really truly curly hair said Cecily mournfully And oh I was so happy! It was dreadful to wake up and find it as straight as ever Felix that sober solid fellow dreamed constantly of flying through the air His descriptions of his aerial flights over the tree-tops of dreamland always filled us with envy None of the rest of us could ever compass such a dream not even the Story Girl who might have been expected to dream of flying if anybody did Felix had a knack of dreaming anyhow and his dream book while suffering somewhat in comparison of literary style was about the best of the lot when it came to subject matter Cecilys might be more dramatic but Felixs was more amusing The dream which we all counted his masterpiece was the one in which a menagerie had camped in the orchard and the rhinoceros chased Aunt Janet around and around the Pulpit Stone but turned into an inoffensive pig when it was on the point of catching her Felix had a sick spell soon after we began our dream books and Aunt Janet essayed to cure him by administering a dose of liver pills which Elder Frewen had assured her were a cure-all for every disease the flesh is heir to But Felix flatly refused to take liver pills; Mexican Tea he would drink but liver pills he would not take in spite of his own suffering and Aunt Janets commands and entreaties I could not understand his antipathy to the insignificant little white pellets which were so easy to swallow; but he explained the matter to us in the orchard when he had recovered his usual health and spirits I was afraid to take the liver pills for fear theyd prevent me from dreaming he said Dont you remember old Miss Baxter in Toronto Bev? And how she told Mrs McLaren that she was subject to terrible dreams and finally she took two liver pills and never had any more dreams after that Id rather have died than risk it concluded Felix solemnly Id an exciting dream last night for once said Dan triumphantly I dreamt old Peg Bowen chased me I thought I was up to her house and she took after me You bet I scooted And she caught me--yes sir! I felt her skinny hand reach out and clutch my shoulder I let out a screech--and woke up I should think you did screech said Felicity We heard you clean over into our room I hate to dream of being chased because I can never run said Sara Ray with a shiver I just stand rooted to the ground--and see it coming--and cant stir It dont sound much written out but its awful to go through Im sure I hope Ill never dream Peg Bowen chases me Ill die if I do I wonder what Peg Bowen would really do to a fellow if she caught him speculated Dan Peg Bowen doesnt need to catch you to do things to you said Peter ominously She can put ill-luck on you just by looking at you--and she will if you offend her I dont believe that said the Story Girl airily Dont you? All right then! Last summer she called at Lem Hills in Markdale and he told her to clear out or hed set the dog on her Peg cleared out and she went across his pasture muttering to herself and throwing her arms round And next day his very best cow took sick and died How do you account for that? It might have happened anyhow said the Story Girl--somewhat less assuredly though It might But Id just as soon Peg Bowen didnt look at MY cows said Peter As if you had any cows! giggled Felicity Im going to have cows some day said Peter flushing I dont mean to be a hired boy all my life Ill have a farm of my own and cows and everything Youll see if I wont I dreamed last night that we opened the blue chest said the Story Girl and all the things were there--the blue china candlestick--only it was brass in the dream--and the fruit basket with the apple on it and the wedding dress and the embroidered petticoat And we were laughing and trying the things on and having such fun And Rachel Ward herself came and looked at us--so sad and reproachful--and we all felt ashamed and I began to cry and woke up crying I dreamed last night that Felix was thin said Peter laughing He did look so queer His clothes just hung loose and he was going round trying to hold them on Everybody thought this was funny except Felix He would not speak to Peter for two days because of it Felicity also got into trouble because of her dreams One night she woke up having just had a very exciting dream; but she went to sleep again and in the morning she could not remember the dream at all Felicity determined she would never let another dream get away from her in such a fashion; and the next time she wakened in the night--having dreamed that she was dead and buried--she promptly arose lighted a candle and proceeded to write the dream down then and there While so employed she contrived to upset the candle and set fire to her nightgown--a brand-new one trimmed with any quantity of crocheted lace A huge hole was burned in it and when Aunt Janet discovered it she lifted up her voice with no uncertain sound Felicity had never received a sharper scolding But she took it very philosophically She was used to her mothers bitter tongue and she was not unduly sensitive Anyhow I saved my dream she said placidly And that of course was all that really mattered Grown people were so strangely oblivious to the truly important things of life Material for new garments of night or day could be bought in any shop for a trifling sum and made up out of hand But if a dream escape you in what market-place the wide world over can you hope to regain it? What coin of earthly minting will ever buy back for you that lost and lovely vision? CHAPTER XXIII SUCH STUFF AS DREAMS ARE MADE ON Peter took Dan and me aside one evening as we were on our way to the orchard with our dream books saying significantly that he wanted our advice Accordingly we went round to the spruce wood where the girls would not see us to the rousing of their curiosity and then Peter told us of his dilemma Last night I dreamed I was in church he said I thought it was full of people and I walked up the aisle to your pew and set down as unconcerned as a pig on ice And then I found that I hadnt a stitch of clothes on--NOT ONE BLESSED STITCH Now --Peter dropped his voice-- what is bothering me is this--would it be proper to tell a dream like that before the girls? I was of the opinion that it would be rather questionable; but Dan vowed he didnt see why HED tell it quick as any other dream There was nothing bad in it But theyre your own relations said Peter Theyre no relation to me and that makes a difference Besides theyre all such ladylike girls I guess Id better not risk it Im pretty sure Aunt Jane wouldnt think it was proper to tell such a dream And I dont want to offend Fel--any of them So Peter never told that dream nor did he write it down Instead I remember seeing in his dream book under the date of September fifteenth an entry to this effect-- Last nite i dremed a drem it wasent a polit drem so i wont rite it down The girls saw this entry but to their credit be it told they never tried to find out what the drem was As Peter said they were ladies in the best and truest sense of that much abused appellation Full of fun and frolic and mischief they were with all the defects of their qualities and all the wayward faults of youth But no indelicate thought or vulgar word could have been shaped or uttered in their presence Had any of us boys ever been guilty of such Cecilys pale face would have coloured with the blush of outraged purity Felicitys golden head would have lifted itself in the haughty indignation of insulted womanhood and the Story Girls splendid eyes would have flashed with such anger and scorn as would have shrivelled the very soul of the wretched culprit Dan was once guilty of swearing Uncle Alec whipped him for it--the only time he ever so punished any of his children But it was because Cecily cried all night that Dan was filled with saving remorse and repentance He vowed next day to Cecily that he would never swear again and he kept his word All at once the Story Girl and Peter began to forge ahead in the matter of dreaming Their dreams suddenly became so lurid and dreadful and picturesque that it was hard for the rest of us to believe that they were not painting the lily rather freely in their accounts of them But the Story Girl was the soul of honour; and Peter early in life had had his feet set in the path of truthfulness by his Aunt Jane and had never been known to stray from it When they assured us solemnly that their dreams all happened exactly as they described them we were compelled to believe them But there was something up we felt sure of that Peter and the Story Girl certainly had a secret between them which they kept for a whole fortnight There was no finding it out from the Story Girl She had a knack of keeping secrets anyhow; and moreover all that fortnight she was strangely cranky and petulant and we found it was not wise to tease her She was not well so Aunt Olivia told Aunt Janet I dont know what is the matter with the child said the former anxiously She hasnt seemed like herself the past two weeks She complains of headache and she has no appetite and she is a dreadful colour Ill have to see a doctor about her if she doesnt get better soon Give her a good dose of Mexican Tea and try that first said Aunt Janet Ive saved many a doctors bill in my family by using Mexican Tea The Mexican Tea was duly administered but produced no improvement in the condition of the Story Girl who however went on dreaming after a fashion which soon made her dream book a veritable curiosity of literature If we cant soon find out what makes Peter and the Story Girl dream like that the rest of us might as well give up trying to write dream books said Felix discontentedly Finally we did find out Felicity wormed the secret out of Peter by the employment of Delilah wiles such as have been the undoing of many a miserable male creature since Samsons day She first threatened that she would never speak to him again if he didnt tell her; and then she promised him that if he did she would let him walk beside her to and from Sunday School all the rest of the summer and carry her books for her Peter was not proof against this double attack He yielded and told the secret I expected the Story Girl would overwhelm him with scorn and indignation But she took it very coolly I knew Felicity would get it out of him sometime she said I think he has done well to hold out this long Peter and the Story Girl so it appeared had wooed wild dreams to their pillows by the simple device of eating rich indigestible things before they went to bed Aunt Olivia knew nothing about it of course She permitted them only a plain wholesome lunch at bed-time But during the day the Story Girl would smuggle upstairs various tidbits from the pantry putting half in Peters room and half in her own; and the result was these visions which had been our despair Last night I ate a piece of mince pie she said and a lot of pickles and two grape jelly tarts But I guess I overdid it because I got real sick and couldnt sleep at all so of course I didnt have any dreams I should have stopped with the pie and pickles and left the tarts alone Peter did and he had an elegant dream that Peg Bowen caught him and put him on to boil alive in that big black pot that hangs outside her door He woke up before the water got hot though Well Miss Felicity youre pretty smart But how will you like to walk to Sunday School with a boy who wears patched trousers? I wont have to said Felicity triumphantly Peter is having a new suit made Its to be ready by Saturday I knew that before I promised Having discovered how to produce exciting dreams we all promptly followed the example of Peter and the Story Girl There is no chance for me to have any horrid dreams lamented Sara Ray because ma wont let me having anything at all to eat before I go to bed I dont think its fair Cant you hide something away through the day as we do? asked Felicity No Sara shook her fawn-coloured head mournfully Ma always keeps the pantry locked for fear Judy Pineau will treat her friends For a week we ate unlawful lunches and dreamed dreams after our own hearts--and I regret to say bickered and squabbled incessantly throughout the daytime for our digestions went out of order and our tempers followed suit Even the Story Girl and I had a fight--something that had never happened before Peter was the only one who kept his normal poise Nothing could upset that boys stomach One night Cecily came into the pantry with a large cucumber and proceeded to devour the greater part of it The grown-ups were away that evening attending a lecture at Markdale so we ate our snacks openly without any recourse to ways that were dark I remember I supped that night off a solid hunk of fat pork topped off with a slab of cold plum pudding I thought you didnt like cucumber Cecily Dan remarked Neither I do said Cecily with a grimace But Peter says theyre splendid for dreaming He et one that night he had the dream about being caught by cannibals Id eat three cucumbers if I could have a dream like that Cecily finished her cucumber and then drank a glass of milk just as we heard the wheels of Uncle Alecs buggy rambling over the bridge in the hollow Felicity quickly restored pork and pudding to their own places and by the time Aunt Janet came in we were all in our respective beds Soon the house was dark and silent I was just dropping into an uneasy slumber when I heard a commotion in the girls room across the hall Their door opened and through our own open door I saw Felicitys white-clad figure flit down the stairs to Aunt Janets room From the room she had left came moans and cries Cecilys sick said Dan springing out of bed That cucumber must have disagreed with her In a few minutes the whole house was astir Cecily was sick--very very sick there was no doubt of that She was even worse than Dan had been when he had eaten the bad berries Uncle Alec tired as he was from his hard days work and evening outing was despatched for the doctor Aunt Janet and Felicity administered all the homely remedies they could think of but to no effect Felicity told Aunt Janet of the cucumber but Aunt Janet did not think the cucumber alone could be responsible for Cecilys alarming condition Cucumbers are indigestible but I never knew of them making any one as sick as this she said anxiously What made the child eat a cucumber before going to bed? I didnt think she liked them It was that wretched Peter sobbed Felicity indignantly He told her it would make her dream something extra What on earth did she want to dream for? demanded Aunt Janet in bewilderment Oh to have something worth while to write in her dream book ma We all have dream books you know and every one wants their own to be the most exciting--and weve been eating rich things to make us dream--and it does--but if Cecily--oh Ill never forgive myself said Felicity incoherently letting all kinds of cats out of the bag in her excitement and alarm Well I wonder what on earth you young ones will do next said Aunt Janet in the helpless tone of a woman who gives it up Cecily was no better when the doctor came Like Aunt Janet he declared that cucumbers alone would not have made her so ill; but when he found out that she had drunk a glass of milk also the mystery was solved Why milk and cucumbers together make a rank poison he said No wonder the child is sick There--there now-- seeing the alarmed faces around him dont be frightened As old Mrs Fraser says Its no deidly It wont kill her but shell probably be a pretty miserable girl for two or three days She was And we were all miserable in company Aunt Janet investigated the whole affair and the matter of our dream books was aired in family conclave I do not know which hurt our feelings most--the scolding we got from Aunt Janet or the ridicule which the other grown-ups especially Uncle Roger showered on us Peter received an extra setting down which he considered rank injustice I didnt tell Cecily to drink the milk and the cucumber alone wouldnt have hurt her he grumbled Cecily was able to be out with us again that day so Peter felt that he might venture on a grumble Sides she coaxed me to tell her what would be good for dreams I just told her as a favour And now your Aunt Janet blames me for the whole trouble And Aunt Janet says we are never to have anything to eat before we go to bed after this except plain bread and milk said Felix sadly Theyd like to stop us from dreaming altogether if they could said the Story Girl wrathfully Well anyway they cant prevent us from growing up consoled Dan We neednt worry about the bread and milk rule added Felicity Ma made a rule like that once before and kept it for a week and then we just slipped back to the old way That will be what will happen this time too But of course we wont be able to get any more rich things for supper and our dreams will be pretty flat after this Well lets go down to the Pulpit Stone and Ill tell you a story I know said the Story Girl We went--and straightway drank of the waters of forgetfulness In a brief space we were laughing right merrily no longer remembering our wrongs at the hands of those cruel grown-ups Our laughter echoed back from the barns and the spruce grove as if elfin denizens of upper air were sharing in our mirth Presently also the laughter of the grown-ups mingled with ours Aunt Olivia and Uncle Roger Aunt Janet and Uncle Alec came strolling through the orchard and joined our circle as they sometimes did when the toil of the day was over and the magic time twixt light and dark brought truce of care and labour Twas then we liked our grown-ups best for then they seemed half children again Uncle Roger and Uncle Alec lolled in the grass like boys; Aunt Olivia looking more like a pansy than ever in the prettiest dress of pale purple print with a knot of yellow ribbon at her throat sat with her arm about Cecily and smiled on us all; and Aunt Janets motherly face lost its every-day look of anxious care The Story Girl was in great fettle that night Never had her tales sparkled with such wit and archness Sara Stanley said Aunt Olivia shaking her finger at her after a side-splitting yarn if you dont watch out youll be famous some day These funny stories are all right said Uncle Roger but for real enjoyment give me something with a creep in it Sara tell us that story of the Serpent Woman I heard you tell one day last summer The Story Girl began it glibly But before she had gone far with it I who was sitting beside her felt an unaccountable repulsion creeping over me For the first time since I had known her I wanted to draw away from the Story Girl Looking around on the faces of the group I saw that they all shared my feeling Cecily had put her hands over her eyes Peter was staring at the Story Girl with a fascinated horror-strickened gaze Aunt Olivia was pale and troubled All looked as if they were held prisoners in the bonds of a fearsome spell which they would gladly break but could not It was not our Story Girl who sat there telling that weird tale in a sibilant curdling voice She had put on a new personality like a garment and that personality was a venomous evil loathly thing I would rather have died than have touched the slim brown wrist on which she supported herself The light in her narrowed orbs was the cold merciless gleam of the serpents eye I felt frightened of this unholy creature who had suddenly come in our dear Story Girls place When the tale ended there was a brief silence Then Aunt Janet said severely but with a sigh of relief Little girls shouldnt tell such horrible stories This truly Aunt Janetian remark broke the spell The grown-ups laughed rather shakily and the Story Girl--our own dear Story Girl once more and no Serpent Woman--said protestingly Well Uncle Roger asked me to tell it I dont like telling such stories either They make me feel dreadful Do you know for just a little while I felt exactly like a snake You looked like one said Uncle Roger How on earth do you do it? I cant explain how I do it said the Story Girl perplexedly It just does itself Genius can never explain how it does it It would not be genius if it could And the Story Girl had genius As we left the orchard I walked along behind Uncle Roger and Aunt Olivia That was an uncanny exhibition for a girl of fourteen you know Roger said Aunt Olivia musingly What is in store for that child? Fame said Uncle Roger If she ever has a chance that is and I suppose her father will see to that At least I hope he will You and I Olivia never had our chance I hope Sara will have hers This was my first inkling of what I was to understand more fully in later years Uncle Roger and Aunt Olivia had both cherished certain dreams and ambitions in youth but circumstances had denied them their chance and those dreams had never been fulfilled Some day Olivia went on Uncle Roger you and I may find ourselves the aunt and uncle of the foremost actress of her day If a girl of fourteen can make a couple of practical farmers and a pair of matter-of-fact housewives half believe for ten minutes that she really is a snake what wont she be able to do when she is thirty? Here you added Uncle Roger perceiving me cut along and get off to your bed And mind you dont eat cucumbers and milk before you go CHAPTER XXIV THE BEWITCHMENT OF PAT We were all in the doleful dumps--at least all we young fry were and even the grown-ups were sorry and condescended to take an interest in our troubles Pat our own dear frolicsome Paddy was sick again--very very sick On Friday he moped and refused his saucer of new milk at milking time The next morning he stretched himself down on the platform by Uncle Rogers back door laid his head on his black paws and refused to take any notice of anything or anybody In vain we stroked and entreated and brought him tidbits Only when the Story Girl caressed him did he give one plaintive little mew as if to ask piteously why she could not do something for him At that Cecily and Felicity and Sara Ray all began crying and we boys felt choky Indeed I caught Peter behind Aunt Olivias dairy later in the day and if ever a boy had been crying I vow that boy was Peter Nor did he deny it when I taxed him with it but he would not give in that he was crying about Paddy Nonsense! What were you crying for then? I said Im crying because--because my Aunt Jane is dead said Peter defiantly But your Aunt Jane died two years ago I said skeptically Well aint that all the more reason for crying? retorted Peter Ive had to do without her for two years and thats worse than if it had just been a few days I believe you were crying because Pat is so sick I said firmly As if Id cry about a cat! scoffed Peter And he marched off whistling Of course we had tried the lard and powder treatment again smearing Pats paws and sides liberally But to our dismay Pat made no effort to lick it off I tell you hes a mighty sick cat said Peter darkly When a cat dont care what he looks like hes pretty far gone If we only knew what was the matter with him we might do something sobbed the Story Girl stroking her poor pets unresponsive head I could tell you whats the matter with him but youd only laugh at me said Peter We all looked at him Peter Craig what do you mean? asked Felicity Zackly what I say Then if you know what is the matter with Paddy tell us commanded the Story Girl standing up She said it quietly; but Peter obeyed I think he would have obeyed if she in that tone and with those eyes had ordered him to cast himself into the depths of the sea I know I should Hes BEWITCHED--thats whats the matter with him said Peter half defiantly half shamefacedly Bewitched? Nonsense! There now what did I tell you? complained Peter The Story Girl looked at Peter at the rest of us and then at poor Pat How could he be bewitched? she asked irresolutely and who could bewitch him? I dont know HOW he was bewitched said Peter Id have to be a witch myself to know that But Peg Bowen bewitched him Nonsense! said the Story Girl again All right said Peter You dont have to believe me If Peg Bowen could bewitch anything--and I dont believe she could--why should she bewitch Pat? asked the Story Girl Everybody here and at Uncle Alecs is always kind to her Ill tell you why said Peter Thursday afternoon when you fellows were all in school Peg Bowen came here Your Aunt Olivia gave her a lunch--a good one You may laugh at the notion of Peg being a witch but I notice your folks are always awful good to her when she comes and awful careful never to offend her Aunt Olivia would be good to any poor creature and so would mother said Felicity And of course nobody wants to offend Peg because she is spiteful and she once set fire to a mans barn in Markdale when he offended her But she isnt a witch--thats ridiculous All right But wait till I tell you When Peg Bowen was leaving Pat stretched out on the steps She tramped on his tail You know Pat doesnt like to have his tail meddled with He slewed himself round and clawed her bare foot If youd just seen the look she gave him youd know whether she was a witch or not And she went off down the lane muttering and throwing her hands round just like she did in Lem Hills cow pasture She put a spell on Pat thats what she did He was sick the next morning We looked at each other in miserable perplexed silence We were only children--and we believed that there had been such things as witches once upon a time--and Peg Bowen WAS an eerie creature If thats so--though I cant believe it--we cant do anything said the Story Girl drearily Pat must die Cecily began to weep afresh Id do anything to save Pats life she said Id BELIEVE anything Theres nothing we can do said Felicity impatiently I suppose sobbed Cecily we might go to Peg Bowen and ask her to forgive Pat and take the spell off him She might if we apologized real humble At first we were appalled by the suggestion We didnt believe that Peg Bowen was a witch But to go to her--to seek her out in that mysterious woodland retreat of hers which was invested with all the terrors of the unknown! And that this suggestion should come from timid Cecily of all people! But then there was poor Pat! Would it do any good? said the Story Girl desperately Even if she did make Pat sick I suppose it would only make her crosser if we went and accused her of bewitching him Besides she didnt do anything of the sort But there was some uncertainty in the Story Girls voice It wouldnt do any harm to try said Cecily If she didnt make him sick it wont matter if she is cross It wont matter to Pat but it might to the one who goes to her said Felicity She isnt a witch but shes a spiteful old woman and goodness knows what shed do to us if she caught us Im scared of Peg Bowen and I dont care who knows it Ever since I can mind mas been saying If youre not good Peg Bowen will catch you If I thought she really made Pat sick and could make him better Id try to pacify her somehow said the Story Girl decidedly Im frightened of her too--but just look at poor darling Paddy We looked at Paddy who continued to stare fixedly before him with unwinking eyes Uncle Roger came out and looked at him also with what seemed to us positively brutal unconcern Im afraid its all up with Pat he said Uncle Roger said Cecily imploringly Peter says Peg Bowen has bewitched Pat for scratching her Do you think it can be so? Did Pat scratch Peg? asked Uncle Roger with a horror-stricken face Dear me! Dear me! That mystery is solved Poor Pat! Uncle Roger nodded his head as if resigning himself and Pat to the worst Do you really think Peg Bowen is a witch Uncle Roger? demanded the Story Girl incredulously Do I think Peg Bowen is a witch? My dear Sara what do YOU think of a woman who can turn herself into a black cat whenever she likes? Is she a witch? Or is she not? I leave it to you Can Peg Bowen turn herself into a black cat? asked Felix staring Its my belief that that is the least of Peg Bowens accomplishments answered Uncle Roger Its the easiest thing in the world for a witch to turn herself into any animal you choose to mention Yes Pat is bewitched--no doubt of that--not the least in the world What are you telling those children such stuff for? asked Aunt Olivia passing on her way to the well Its an irresistible temptation answered Uncle Roger strolling over to carry her pail You can see your Uncle Roger believes Peg is a witch said Peter And you can see Aunt Olivia doesnt I said and I dont either See here said the Story Girl resolutely I dont believe it but there MAY be something in it Suppose there is The question is what can we do? Ill tell you what ID do said Peter Id take a present for Peg and ask her to make Pat well I wouldnt let on I thought shed made him sick Then she couldnt be offended--and maybe shed take the spell off I think wed better all give her something said Felicity Im willing to do that But whos going to take the presents to her? We must all go together said the Story Girl I wont cried Sara Ray in terror I wouldnt go near Peg Bowens house for the world no matter who was with me Ive thought of a plan said the Story Girl Lets all give her something as Felicity says And let us all go up to her place this evening and if we see her outside well just go quietly and set the things down before her with the letter and say nothing but come respectfully away If shell let us said Dan significantly Can Peg read a letter? I asked Oh yes Aunt Olivia says she is a good scholar She went to school and was a smart girl until she became crazy Well write it very plain What if we dont see her? asked Felicity Well put the things on her doorstep then and leave them She may be miles away over the country by this time sighed Cecily and never find them until its too late for Pat But its the only thing to do What can we give her? We mustnt offer her any money said the Story Girl Shes very indignant when any one does that She says she isnt a beggar But shell take anything else I shall give her my string of blue beads Shes fond of finery Ill give her that sponge cake I made this morning said Felicity I guess she doesnt get sponge cake very often Ive nothing but the rheumatism ring I got as a premium for selling needles last winter said Peter Ill give her that Even if she hasnt got rheumatism its a real handsome ring It looks like solid gold Ill give her a roll of peppermint candy said Felix Ill give one of those little jars of cherry preserve I made said Cecily I wont go near her quavered Sara Ray but I want to do something for Pat and Ill send that piece of apple leaf lace I knit last week I decided to give the redoubtable Peg some apples from my birthday tree and Dan declared he would give her a plug of tobacco Oh wont she be insulted? exclaimed Felix rather horrified Naw grinned Dan Peg chews tobacco like a man Shed rather have it than your rubbishy peppermints I can tell you Ill run down to old Mrs Sampsons and get a plug Now we must write the letter and take it and the presents to her right away before it gets dark said the Story Girl We adjourned to the granary to indite the important document which the Story Girl was to compose How shall I begin it? she asked in perplexity It would never do to say Dear Peg and Dear Miss Bowen sounds too ridiculous Besides nobody knows whether she is Miss Bowen or not said Felicity She went to Boston when she grew up and some say she was married there and her husband deserted her and thats why she went crazy If shes married she wont like being called Miss Well how am I to address her? asked the Story Girl in despair Peter again came to the rescue with a practical suggestion Begin it Respected Madam he said Ma has a letter a school trustee once writ to my Aunt Jane and thats how it begins Respected Madam wrote the Story Girl We want to ask a very great favour of you and we hope you will kindly grant it if you can Our favourite cat Paddy is very sick and we are afraid he is going to die Do you think you could cure him? And will you please try? We are all so fond of him and he is such a good cat and has no bad habits Of course if any of us tramps on his tail he will scratch us but you know a cat cant bear to have his tail tramped on Its a very tender part of him and its his only way of preventing it and he doesnt mean any harm If you can cure Paddy for us we will always be very very grateful to you The accompanying small offerings are a testimonial of our respect and gratitude and we entreat you to honour us by accepting them Very respectfully yours SARA STANLEY I tell you that last sentence has a fine sound said Peter admiringly I didnt make that up admitted the Story Girl honestly I read it somewhere and remembered it I think its TOO fine criticized Felicity Peg Bowen wont know the meaning of such big words But it was decided to leave them in and we all signed the letter Then we got our testimonials and started on our reluctant journey to the domains of the witch Sara Ray would not go of course but she volunteered to stay with Pat while we were away We did not think it necessary to inform the grown-ups of our errand or its nature Grown-ups had such peculiar views They might forbid our going at all--and they would certainly laugh at us Peg Bowens house was nearly a mile away even by the short cut past the swamp and up the wooded hill We went down through the brook field and over the little plank bridge in the hollow half lost in its surrounding sea of farewell summers When we reached the green gloom of the woods beyond we began to feel frightened but nobody would admit it We walked very closely together and we did not talk When you are near the retreat of witches and folk of that ilk the less you say the better for their feelings are so notoriously touchy Of course Peg wasnt a witch but it was best to be on the safe side Finally we came to the lane which led directly to her abode We were all very pale now and our hearts were beating The red September sun hung low between the tall spruces to the west It did not look to me just right for a sun In fact everything looked uncanny I wished our errand were well over A sudden bend in the lane brought us out to the little clearing where Pegs house was before we were half ready to see it In spite of my fear I looked at it with some curiosity It was a small shaky building with a sagging roof set amid a perfect jungle of weeds To our eyes the odd thing about it was that there was no entrance on the ground floor as there should be in any respectable house The only door was in the upper story and was reached by a flight of rickety steps There was no sign of life about the place except--sight of ill omen--a large black cat sitting on the topmost step We thought of Uncle Rogers gruesome hints Could that black cat be Peg? Nonsense! But still--it didnt look like an ordinary cat It was so large--and had such green malicious eyes! Plainly there was something out of the common about the beastie! In a tense breathless silence the Story Girl placed our parcels on the lowest step and laid her letter on the top of the pile Her brown fingers trembled and her face was very pale Suddenly the door above us opened and Peg Bowen herself appeared on the threshold She was a tall sinewy old woman wearing a short ragged drugget skirt which reached scantly below her knees a scarlet print blouse and a mans hat Her feet arms and neck were bare and she had a battered old clay pipe in her mouth Her brown face was seamed with a hundred wrinkles and her tangled grizzled hair fell unkemptly over her shoulders She was scowling and her flashing black eyes held no friendly light We had borne up bravely enough hitherto in spite of our inward unconfessed quakings But now our strained nerves gave way and sheer panic seized us Peter gave a little yelp of pure terror We turned and fled across the clearing and into the woods Down the long hill we tore like mad hunted creatures firmly convinced that Peg Bowen was after us Wild was that scamper as nightmare-like as any recorded in our dream books The Story Girl was in front of me and I can recall the tremendous leaps she made over fallen logs and little spruce bushes with her long brown curls streaming out behind her from their scarlet fillet Cecily behind me kept gasping out the contradictory sentences Oh Bev wait for me and Oh Bev hurry hurry! More by blind instinct than anything else we kept together and found our way out of the woods Presently we were in the field beyond the brook Over us was a dainty sky of shell pink placid cows were pasturing around us; the farewell summers nodded to us in the friendly breezes We halted with a glad realization that we were back in our own haunts and that Peg Bowen had not caught us Oh wasnt that an awful experience? gasped Cecily shuddering I wouldnt go through it again--I couldnt not even for Pat It come on a fellow so suddent said Peter shamefacedly I think I could a-stood my ground if Id known she was going to come out But when she popped out like that I thought I was done for We shouldnt have run said Felicity gloomily It showed we were afraid of her and that always makes her awful cross She wont do a thing for Pat now I dont believe she could do anything anyway said the Story Girl I think weve just been a lot of geese We were all except Peter more or less inclined to agree with her And the conviction of our folly deepened when we reached the granary and found that Pat watched over by the faithful Sara Ray was no better The Story Girl announced that she would take him into the kitchen and sit up all night with him He shant die alone anyway she said miserably gathering his limp body up in her arms We did not think Aunt Olivia would give her permission to stay up; but Aunt Olivia did Aunt Olivia really was a duck We wanted to stay with her also but Aunt Janet wouldnt hear of such a thing She ordered us off to bed saying that it was positively sinful in us to be so worked up over a cat Five heart-broken children who knew that there are many worse friends than dumb furry folk climbed Uncle Alecs stairs to bed that night Theres nothing we can do now except pray God to make Pat better said Cecily I must candidly say that her tone savoured strongly of a last resort; but this was owing more to early training than to any lack of faith on Cecilys part She knew and we knew that prayer was a solemn rite not to be lightly held nor degraded to common uses Felicity voiced this conviction when she said I dont believe it would be right to pray about a cat Id like to know why not retorted Cecily God made Paddy just as much as He made you Felicity King though perhaps He didnt go to so much trouble And Im sure Hes abler to help him than Peg Bowen Anyhow Im going to pray for Pat with all my might and main and Id like to see you try to stop me Of course I wont mix it up with more important things Ill just tack it on after Ive finished asking the blessings but before I say amen More petitions than Cecilys were offered up that night on behalf of Paddy I distinctly heard Felix--who always said his prayers in a loud whisper owing to some lasting conviction of early life that God could not hear him if he did not pray audibly--mutter pleadingly after the important part of his devotions was over Oh God please make Pat better by the morning PLEASE do And I even in these late years of irreverence for the dreams of youth am not in the least ashamed to confess that when I knelt down to say my boyish prayer I thought of our little furry comrade in his extremity and prayed as reverently as I knew how for his healing Then I went to sleep comforted by the simple hope that the Great Father would after important things were all attended to remember poor Pat As soon as we were up the next morning we rushed off to Uncle Rogers But we met Peter and the Story Girl in the lane and their faces were as the faces of those who bring glad tidings upon the mountains Pats better cried the Story Girl blithe triumphant Last night just at twelve he began to lick his paws Then he licked himself all over and went to sleep too on the sofa When I woke Pat was washing his face and he has taken a whole saucerful of milk Oh isnt it splendid? You see Peg Bowen did put a spell on him said Peter and then she took it off I guess Cecilys prayer had more to do with Pats getting better than Peg Bowen said Felicity She prayed for Pat over and over again That is why hes better Oh all right said Peter but Id advise Pat not to scratch Peg Bowen again thats all I wish I knew whether it was the praying or Peg Bowen that cured Pat said Felix in perplexity I dont believe it was either of them said Dan Pat just got sick and got better again of his own accord Im going to believe that it was the praying said Cecily decidedly Its so much nicer to believe that God cured Pat than that Peg Bowen did But you oughtnt to believe a thing just cause it would be more comfortable objected Peter Mind you I aint saying God couldnt cure Pat But nothing and nobody cant ever make me believe that Peg Bowen wasnt at the bottom of it all Thus faith superstition and incredulity strove together amongst us as in all history CHAPTER XXV A CUP OF FAILURE One warm Sunday evening in the moon of golden-rod we all grown-ups and children were sitting in the orchard by the Pulpit Stone singing sweet old gospel hymns We could all sing more or less except poor Sara Ray who had once despairingly confided to me that she didnt know what shed ever do when she went to heaven because she couldnt sing a note That whole scene comes out clearly for me in memory--the arc of primrose sky over the trees behind the old house the fruit-laden boughs of the orchard the bank of golden-rod like a wave of sunshine behind the Pulpit Stone the nameless colour seen on a fir wood in a ruddy sunset I can see Uncle Alecs tired brilliant blue eyes Aunt Janets wholesome matronly face Uncle Rogers sweeping blond beard and red cheeks and Aunt Olivias full-blown beauty Two voices ring out for me above all others in the music that echoes through the halls of recollection Cecilys sweet and silvery and Uncle Alecs fine tenor If youre a King you sing was a Carlisle proverb in those days Aunt Julia had been the flower of the flock in that respect and had become a noted concert singer The world had never heard of the rest Their music echoed only along the hidden ways of life and served but to lighten the cares of the trivial round and common task That evening after they tired of singing our grown-ups began talking of their youthful days and doings This was always a keen delight to us small fry We listened avidly to the tales of our uncles and aunts in the days when they too--hard fact to realize--had been children Good and proper as they were now once so it seemed they had gotten into mischief and even had their quarrels and disagreements On this particular evening Uncle Roger told many stories of Uncle Edward and one in which the said Edward had preached sermons at the mature age of ten from the Pulpit Stone fired as the sequel will show the Story Girls imagination Cant I just see him at it now said Uncle Roger leaning over that old boulder his cheeks red and his eyes burning with excitement banging the top of it as he had seen the ministers do in church It wasnt cushioned however and he always bruised his hands in his self-forgetful earnestness We thought him a regular wonder We loved to hear him preach but we didnt like to hear him pray because he always insisted on praying for each of us by name and it made us feel wretchedly uncomfortable somehow Alec do you remember how furious Julia was because Edward prayed one day that she might be preserved from vanity and conceit over her singing? I should think I do laughed Uncle Alec She was sitting right there where Cecily is now and she got up at once and marched right out of the orchard but at the gate she turned to call back indignantly I guess youd better wait till youve prayed the conceit out of yourself before you begin on me Ned King I never heard such stuck-up sermons as you preach Ned went on praying and never let on he heard her but at the end of his prayer he wound up with Oh God I pray you to keep an eye on us all but I pray you to pay particular attention to my sister Julia for I think she needs it even more than the rest of us world without end Amen Our uncles roared with laughter over the recollection We all laughed indeed especially over another tale in which Uncle Edward leaning too far over the pulpit in his earnestness lost his balance altogether and tumbled ingloriously into the grass below He lit on a big Scotch thistle said Uncle Roger chuckling and besides that he skinned his forehead on a stone But he was determined to finish his sermon and finish it he did He climbed back into the pulpit with the tears rolling over his cheeks and preached for ten minutes longer with sobs in his voice and drops of blood on his forehead He was a plucky little beggar No wonder he succeeded in life And his sermons and prayers were always just about as outspoken as those Julia objected to said Uncle Alec Well were all getting on in life and Edward is gray; but when I think of him I always see him a little rosy curly-headed chap laying down the law to us from the Pulpit Stone It seems like the other day that we were all here together just as these children are and now we are scattered everywhere Julia in California Edward in Halifax Alan in South America Felix and Felicity and Stephen gone to the land that is very far off There was a little space of silence; and then Uncle Alec began in a low impressive voice to repeat the wonderful verses of the ninetieth Psalm--verses which were thenceforth bound up for us with the beauty of that night and the memories of our kindred Very reverently we all listened to the majestic words Lord thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations Before the mountains were brought forth or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world even from everlasting to everlasting thou art God For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past and as a watch in the night For all our days are passed away in thy wrath; we spend our years as a tale that is told The days of our years are threescore and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off and we fly away So teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom Oh satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days And let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us; and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea the work of our hands establish thou it The dusk crept into the orchard like a dim bewitching personality You could see her--feel her--hear her She tiptoed softly from tree to tree ever drawing nearer Presently her filmy wings hovered over us and through them gleamed the early stars of the autumn night The grown-ups rose reluctantly and strolled away; but we children lingered for a moment to talk over an idea the Story Girl broached--a good idea we thought enthusiastically and one that promised to add considerable spice to life We were on the lookout for some new amusement Dream books had begun to pall We no longer wrote in them very regularly and our dreams were not what they used to be before the mischance of the cucumber So the Story Girls suggestion came pat to the psychological moment Ive thought of a splendid plan she said It just flashed into my mind when the uncles were talking about Uncle Edward And the beauty of it is we can play it on Sundays and you know there are so few things it is proper to play on Sundays But this is a Christian game so it will be all right It isnt like the religious fruit basket game is it? asked Cecily anxiously We had good reason to hope that it wasnt One desperate Sunday afternoon when we had nothing to read and the time seemed endless Felix had suggested that we have a game of fruit-basket; only instead of taking the names of fruits we were to take the names of Bible characters This he argued would make it quite lawful and proper to play on Sunday We too desirous of being convinced also thought so; and for a merry hour Lazarus and Martha and Moses and Aaron and sundry other worthies of Holy Writ had a lively time of it in the King orchard Peter having a Scriptural name of his own did not want to take another; but we would not allow this because it would give him an unfair advantage over the rest of us It would be so much easier to call out your own name than fit your tongue to an unfamiliar one So Peter retaliated by choosing Nebuchadnezzar which no one could ever utter three times before Peter shrieked it out once In the midst of our hilarity however Uncle Alec and Aunt Janet came down upon us It is best to draw a veil over what followed Suffice it to say that the recollection gave point to Cecilys question No it isnt that sort of game at all said the Story Girl It is this; each of you boys must preach a sermon as Uncle Edward used to do One of you next Sunday and another the next and so on And whoever preaches the best sermon is to get a prize Dan promptly declared he wouldnt try to preach a sermon; but Peter Felix and I thought the suggestion a very good one Secretly I believed I could cut quite a fine figure preaching a sermon Wholl give the prize? asked Felix I will said the Story Girl Ill give that picture father sent me last week As the said picture was an excellent copy of one of Landseers stags Felix and I were well pleased; but Peter averred that he would rather have the Madonna that looked like his Aunt Jane and the Story Girl agreed that if his sermon was the best she would give him that But whos to be the judge? I said and what kind of a sermon would you call the best? The one that makes the most impression answered the Story Girl promptly And we girls must be the judges because theres nobody else Now who is to preach next Sunday? It was decided that I should lead off and I lay awake for an extra hour that night thinking what text I should take for the following Sunday The next day I bought two sheets of foolscap from the schoolmaster and after tea I betook myself to the granary barred the door and fell to writing my sermon I did not find it as easy a task as I had anticipated; but I pegged grimly away at it and by dint of severe labour for two evenings I eventually got my four pages of foolscap filled although I had to pad the subject-matter not a little with verses of quotable hymns I had decided to preach on missions as being a topic more within my grasp than abstruse theological doctrines or evangelical discourses; and mindful of the need of making an impression I drew a harrowing picture of the miserable plight of the heathen who in their darkness bowed down to wood and stone Then I urged our responsibility concerning them and meant to wind up by reciting in a very solemn and earnest voice the verse beginning Can we whose souls are lighted When I had completed my sermon I went over it very carefully again and wrote with red ink--Cecily made it for me out of an aniline dye--the word thump wherever I deemed it advisable to chastise the pulpit I have that sermon still all its red thumps unfaded lying beside my dream book; but I am not going to inflict it on my readers I am not so proud of it as I once was I was really puffed up with earthly vanity over it at that time Felix I thought would be hard put to it to beat it As for Peter I did not consider him a rival to be feared It was unsupposable that a hired boy with little education and less experience of church-going should be able to preach better than could I in whose family there was a real minister The sermon written the next thing was to learn it off by heart and then practise it thumps included until I was letter and gesture perfect I preached it over several times in the granary with only Paddy sitting immovably on a puncheon for audience Paddy stood the test fairly well At least he made an adorable listener save at such times as imaginary rats distracted his attention Mr Marwood had at least three absorbed listeners the next Sunday morning Felix Peter and I were all among the chiels who were taking mental notes on the art of preaching a sermon Not a motion or glance or intonation escaped us To be sure none of us could remember the text when we got home; but we knew just how you should throw back your head and clutch the edge of the pulpit with both hands when you announced it In the afternoon we all repaired to the orchard Bibles and hymn books in hand We did not think it necessary to inform the grown-ups of what was in the wind You could never tell what kink a grown-up would take They might not think it proper to play any sort of a game on Sunday not even a Christian game Least said was soonest mended where grown-ups were concerned I mounted the pulpit steps feeling rather nervous and my audience sat gravely down on the grass before me Our opening exercises consisted solely of singing and reading We had agreed to omit prayer Neither Felix Peter nor I felt equal to praying in public But we took up a collection The proceeds were to go to missions Dan passed the plate--Felicitys rosebud plate--looking as preternaturally solemn as Elder Frewen himself Every one put a cent on it Well I preached my sermon And it fell horribly flat I realized that before I was half way through it I think I preached it very well; and never a thump did I forget or misplace But my audience was plainly bored When I stepped down from the pulpit after demanding passionately if we whose souls were lighted and so forth I felt with secret humiliation that my sermon was a failure It had made no impression at all Felix would be sure to get the prize That was a very good sermon for a first attempt said the Story Girl graciously It sounded just like real sermons I have heard For a moment the charm of her voice made me feel that I had not done so badly after all; but the other girls thinking it their duty to pay me some sort of a compliment also quickly dispelled that pleasing delusion Every word of it was true said Cecily her tone unconsciously implying that this was its sole merit I often feel said Felicity primly that we dont think enough about the heathens We ought to think a great deal more Sara Ray put the finishing touch to my mortification It was so nice and short she said What was the matter with my sermon? I asked Dan that night Since he was neither judge nor competitor I could discuss the matter with him It was too much like a reglar sermon to be interesting said Dan frankly I should think the more like a regular sermon it was the better I said Not if you want to make an impression said Dan seriously You must have something sort of different for that Peter now HELL have something different Oh Peter! I dont believe he can preach a sermon I said Maybe not but youll see hell make an impression said Dan Dan was neither the prophet nor the son of a prophet but he had the second sight for once; Peter DID make an impression CHAPTER XXVI PETER MAKES AN IMPRESSION Peters turn came next He did not write his sermon out That he averred was too hard work Nor did he mean to take a text Why who ever heard of a sermon without a text? asked Felix blankly I am going to take a SUBJECT instead of a text said Peter loftily I aint going to tie myself down to a text And Im going to have heads in it--three heads You hadnt a single head in yours he added to me Uncle Alec says that Uncle Edward says that heads are beginning to go out of fashion I said defiantly--all the more defiantly that I felt I should have had heads in my sermon It would doubtless have made a much deeper impression But the truth was I had forgotten all about such things Well Im going to have them and I dont care if they are unfashionable said Peter Theyre good things Aunt Jane used to say if a man didnt have heads and stick to them hed go wandering all over the Bible and never get anywhere in particular What are you going to preach on? asked Felix Youll find out next Sunday said Peter significantly The next Sunday was in October and a lovely day it was warm and bland as June There was something in the fine elusive air that recalled beautiful forgotten things and suggested delicate future hopes The woods had wrapped fine-woven gossamers about them and the westering hill was crimson and gold We sat around the Pulpit Stone and waited for Peter and Sara Ray It was the formers Sunday off and he had gone home the night before but he assured us he would be back in time to preach his sermon Presently he arrived and mounted the granite boulder as if to the manor born He was dressed in his new suit and I perceiving this felt that he had the advantage of me When I preached I had to wear my second best suit for it was one of Aunt Janets laws that we should take our good suits off when we came home from church There were I saw compensations for being a hired boy Peter made quite a handsome little minister in his navy blue coat white collar and neatly bowed tie His black eyes shone and his black curls were brushed up in quite a ministerial pompadour but threatened to tumble over at the top in graceless ringlets It was decided that there was no use in waiting for Sara Ray who might or might not come according to the humour in which her mother was Therefore Peter proceeded with the service He read the chapter and gave out the hymn with as much SANG FROID as if he had been doing it all his life Mr Marwood himself could not have bettered the way in which Peter said We will sing the whole hymn omitting the fourth stanza That was a fine touch which I had not thought of I began to think that after all Peter might be a foeman worthy of my steel When Peter was ready to begin he thrust his hands into his pockets--a totally unorthodox thing Then he plunged in without further ado speaking in his ordinary conversational tone--another unorthodox thing There was no shorthand reporter present to take that sermon down; but if necessary I could preach it over verbatim and so I doubt not could everyone that heard it It was not a forgettable kind of sermon Dearly beloved said Peter my sermon is about the bad place--in short about hell An electric shock seemed to run through the audience Everybody looked suddenly alert Peter had in one sentence done what my whole sermon had failed to do He had made an impression I shall divide my sermon into three heads pursued Peter The first head is what you must not do if you dont want to go to the bad place The second head is what the bad place is like --sensation in the audience-- and the third head is how to escape going there Now theres a great many things you must not do and its very important to know what they are You ought not to lose no time in finding out In the first place you mustnt ever forget to mind what grown-up people tell you--that is GOOD grown-up people But how are you going to tell who are the good grown-up people? asked Felix suddenly forgetting that he was in church Oh that is easy said Peter You can always just FEEL who is good and who isnt And you mustnt tell lies and you mustnt murder any one You must be specially careful not to murder any one You might be forgiven for telling lies if you was real sorry for them but if you murdered any one it would be pretty hard to get forgiven so youd better be on the safe side And you mustnt commit suicide because if you did that you wouldnt have any chance of repenting it; and you mustnt forget to say your prayers and you mustnt quarrel with your sister At this point Felicity gave Dan a significant poke with her elbow and Dan was up in arms at once Dont you be preaching at me Peter Craig he cried out I wont stand it I dont quarrel with my sister any oftener than she quarrels with me You can just leave me alone Whos touching you? demanded Peter I didnt mention no names A minister can say anything he likes in the pulpit as long as he doesnt mention any names and nobody can answer back All right but just you wait till to-morrow growled Dan subsiding reluctantly into silence under the reproachful looks of the girls You must not play any games on Sunday went on Peter that is any week-day games--or whisper in church or laugh in church--I did that once but I was awful sorry--and you mustnt take any notice of Paddy--I mean of the family cat at family prayers not even if he climbs up on your back And you mustnt call names or make faces Amen cried Felix who had suffered many things because Felicity so often made faces at him Peter stopped and glared at him over the edge of the Pulpit Stone You havent any business to call out a thing like that right in the middle of a sermon he said They do it in the Methodist church at Markdale protested Felix somewhat abashed I heard them I know they do Thats the Methodist way and it is all right for them I havent a word to say against Methodists My Aunt Jane was one and I might have been one myself if I hadnt been so scared of the Judgment Day But you aint a Methodist Youre a Presbyterian aint you? Yes of course I was born that way Very well then youve got to do things the Presbyterian way Dont let me hear any more of your amens or Ill amen you Oh dont anybody interrupt again implored the Story Girl It isnt fair How can any one preach a good sermon if he is always being interrupted? Nobody interrupted Beverley Bev didnt get up there and pitch into us like that muttered Dan You mustnt fight resumed Peter undauntedly That is you mustnt fight for the fun of fighting nor out of bad temper You must not say bad words or swear You mustnt get drunk--although of course you wouldnt be likely to do that before you grow up and the girls never Theres probly a good many other things you mustnt do but these Ive named are the most important Of course Im not saying youll go to the bad place for sure if you do them I only say youre running a risk The devil is looking out for the people who do these things and hell be more likely to get after them than to waste time over the people who dont do them And thats all about the first head of my sermon At this point Sara Ray arrived somewhat out of breath Peter looked at her reproachfully Youve missed my whole first head Sara he said that isnt fair when youre to be one of the judges I think I ought to preach it over again for you That was really done once I know a story about it said the Story Girl Whos interrupting now? aid Dan slyly Never mind tell us the story said the preacher himself eagerly leaning over the pulpit It was Mr Scott who did it said the Story Girl He was preaching somewhere in Nova Scotia and when he was more than half way through his sermon--and you know sermons were VERY long in those days--a man walked in Mr Scott stopped until he had taken his seat Then he said My friend you are very late for this service I hope you wont be late for heaven The congregation will excuse me if I recapitulate the sermon for our friends benefit And then he just preached the sermon over again from the beginning It is said that that particular man was never known to be late for church again It served him right said Dan but it was pretty hard lines on the rest of the congregation Now lets be quiet so Peter can go on with his sermon said Cecily Peter squared his shoulders and took hold of the edge of the pulpit Never a thump had he thumped but I realized that his way of leaning forward and fixing this one or that one of his hearers with his eye was much more effective Ive come now to the second head of my sermon--what the bad place is like He proceeded to describe the bad place Later on we discovered that he had found his material in an illustrated translation of Dantes _Inferno_ which had once been given to his Aunt Jane as a school prize But at the time we supposed he must be drawing from Biblical sources Peter had been reading the Bible steadily ever since what we always referred to as the Judgment Sunday and he was by now almost through it None of the rest of us had ever read the Bible completely through and we thought Peter must have found his description of the world of the lost in some portion with which we were not acquainted Therefore his utterances carried all the weight of inspiration and we sat appalled before his lurid phrases He used his own words to clothe the ideas he had found and the result was a force and simplicity that struck home to our imaginations Suddenly Sara Ray sprang to her feet with a scream--a scream that changed into strange laughter We all preacher included looked at her aghast Cecily and Felicity sprang up and caught hold of her Sara Ray was really in a bad fit of hysterics but we knew nothing of such a thing in our experience and we thought she had gone mad She shrieked cried laughed and flung herself about Shes gone clean crazy said Peter coming down out of his pulpit with a very pale face Youve frightened her crazy with your dreadful sermon said Felicity indignantly She and Cecily each took Sara by an arm and half leading half carrying got her out of the orchard and up to the house The rest of us looked at each other in terrified questioning Youve made rather too much of an impression Peter said the Story Girl miserably She neednt have got so scared If shed only waited for the third head Id have showed her how easy it was to get clear of going to the bad place and go to heaven instead But you girls are always in such a hurry said Peter bitterly Do you spose theyll have to take her to the asylum? said Dan in a whisper Hush heres your father said Felix Uncle Alec came striding down the orchard We had never before seen Uncle Alec angry But there was no doubt that he was very angry His blue eyes fairly blazed at us as he said What have you been doing to frighten Sara Ray into such a condition? We--we were just having a sermon contest explained the Story Girl tremulously And Peter preached about the bad place and it frightened Sara That is all Uncle Alec All! I dont know what the result will be to that nervous delicate child She is shrieking in there and nothing will quiet her What do you mean by playing such a game on Sunday and making a jest of sacred things? No not a word-- for the Story Girl had attempted to speak You and Peter march off home And the next time I find you up to such doings on Sunday or any other day Ill give you cause to remember it to your latest hour The Story Girl and Peter went humbly home and we went with them I CANT understand grown-up people said Felix despairingly When Uncle Edward preached sermons it was all right but when we do it it is making a jest of sacred things And I heard Uncle Alec tell a story once about being nearly frightened to death when he was a little boy by a minister preaching on the end of the world; and he said That was something like a sermon You dont hear such sermons nowadays But when Peter preaches just such a sermon its a very different story Its no wonder we cant understand the grown-ups said the Story Girl indignantly because weve never been grown-up ourselves But THEY have been children and I dont see why they cant understand us Of course perhaps we shouldnt have had the contest on Sundays But all the same I think its mean of Uncle Alec to be so cross Oh I do hope poor Sara wont have to be taken to the asylum Poor Sara did not have to be She was eventually quieted down and was as well as usual the next day; and she humbly begged Peters pardon for spoiling his sermon Peter granted it rather grumpily and I fear that he never really quite forgave Sara for her untimely outburst Felix too felt resentment against her because he had lost the chance of preaching his sermon Of course I know I wouldnt have got the prize for I couldnt have made such an impression as Peter he said to us mournfully but Id like to have had a chance to show what I could do Thats what comes of having those cry-baby girls mixed up in things Cecily was just as scared as Sara Ray but shed more sense than to show it like that Well Sara couldnt help it said the Story Girl charitably but it does seem as if wed had dreadful luck in everything weve tried lately I thought of a new game this morning but Im almost afraid to mention it for I suppose something dreadful will come of it too Oh tell us what is it? everybody entreated Well its a trial by ordeal and were to see which of us can pass it The ordeal is to eat one of the bitter apples in big mouthfuls without making a single face Dan made a face to begin with I dont believe any of us can do that he said YOU cant if you take bites big enough to fill your mouth giggled Felicity with cruelty and without provocation Well maybe you could retorted Dan sarcastically Youd be so afraid of spoiling your looks that youd rather die than make a face I spose no matter what you et Felicity makes enough faces when theres nothing to make faces at said Felix who had been grimaced at over the breakfast table that morning and hadnt liked it I think the bitter apples would be real good for Felix said Felicity They say sour things make people thin Lets go and get the bitter apples said Cecily hastily seeing that Felix Felicity and Dan were on the verge of a quarrel more bitter than the apples We went to the seedling tree and got an apple apiece The game was that every one must take a bite in turn chew it up and swallow it without making a face Peter again distinguished himself He and he alone passed the ordeal munching those dreadful mouthfuls without so much as a change of expression on his countenance while the facial contortions the rest of us went through baffled description In every subsequent trial it was the same Peter never made a face and no one else could help making them It sent him up fifty per cent in Felicitys estimation Peter is a real smart boy she said to me Its such a pity he is a hired boy But if we could not pass the ordeal we got any amount of fun out of it at least Evening after evening the orchard re-echoed to our peals of laughter Bless the children said Uncle Alec as he carried the milk pails across the yard Nothing can quench their spirits for long CHAPTER XXVII THE ORDEAL OF BITTER APPLES I could never understand why Felix took Peters success in the Ordeal of Bitter Apples so much to heart He had not felt very keenly over the matter of the sermons and certainly the mere fact that Peter could eat sour apples without making faces did not cast any reflection on the honour or ability of the other competitors But to Felix everything suddenly became flat stale and unprofitable because Peter continued to hold the championship of bitter apples It haunted his waking hours and obsessed his nights I heard him talking in his sleep about it If anything could have made him thin the way he worried over this matter would have done it For myself I cared not a groat I had wished to be successful in the sermon contest and felt sore whenever I thought of my failure But I had no burning desire to eat sour apples without grimacing and I did not sympathize over and above with my brother When however he took to praying about it I realized how deeply he felt on the subject and hoped he would be successful Felix prayed earnestly that he might be enabled to eat a bitter apple without making a face And when he had prayed three nights after this manner he contrived to eat a bitter apple without a grimace until he came to the last bite which proved too much for him But Felix was vastly encouraged Another prayer or two and Ill be able to eat a whole one he said jubilantly But this devoutly desired consummation did not come to pass In spite of prayers and heroic attempts Felix could never get beyond that last bite Not even faith and works in combination could avail For a time he could not understand this But he thought the mystery was solved when Cecily came to him one day and told him that Peter was praying against him Hes praying that youll never be able to eat a bitter apple without making a face she said He told Felicity and Felicity told me She said she thought it was real cute of him I think that is a dreadful way to talk about praying and I told her so She wanted me to promise not to tell you but I wouldnt promise because I think its fair for you to know what is going on Felix was very indignant--and aggrieved as well I dont see why God should answer Peters prayers instead of mine he said bitterly Ive gone to church and Sunday School all my life and Peter never went till this summer It isnt fair Oh Felix dont talk like that said Cecily shocked God MUST be fair Ill tell you what I believe is the reason Peter prays three times a day regular--in the morning and at dinner time and at night--and besides that any time through the day when he happens to think of it he just prays standing up Did you ever hear of such goings-on? Well hes got to stop praying against me anyhow said Felix resolutely I wont put up with it and Ill go and tell him so right off Felix marched over to Uncle Rogers and we trailed after scenting a scene We found Peter shelling beans in the granary and whistling cheerily as with a conscience void of offence towards all men Look here Peter said Felix ominously they tell me that youve been praying right along that I couldnt eat a bitter apple Now I tell you-- I never did! exclaimed Peter indignantly I never mentioned your name I never prayed that you couldnt eat a bitter apple I just prayed that Id be the only one that could Well thats the same thing cried Felix Youve just been praying for the opposite to me out of spite And youve got to stop it Peter Craig Well I just guess I wont said Peter angrily Ive just as good a right to pray for what I want as you Felix King even if you was brought up in Toronto I spose you think a hired boy hasnt any business to pray for particular things but Ill show you Ill just pray for what I please and Id like to see you try and stop me Youll have to fight me if you keep on praying against me said Felix The girls gasped; but Dan and I were jubilant snuffing battle afar off All right I can fight as well as pray Oh dont fight implored Cecily I think it would be dreadful Surely you can arrange it some other way Lets all give up the Ordeal anyway There isnt much fun in it And then neither of you need pray about it I dont want to give up the Ordeal said Felix and I wont Oh well surely you can settle it some way without fighting persisted Cecily Im not wanting to fight said Peter Its Felix If he dont interfere with my prayers theres no need of fighting But if he does theres no other way to settle it But how will that settle it? asked Cecily Oh whoevers licked will have to give in about the praying said Peter Thats fair enough If Im licked I wont pray for that particular thing any more Its dreadful to fight about anything so religious as praying sighed poor Cecily Why they were always fighting about religion in old times said Felix The more religious anything was the more fighting there was about it A fellows got a right to pray as he pleases said Peter and if anybody tries to stop him hes bound to fight Thats my way of looking at it What would Miss Marwood say if she knew you were going to fight? asked Felicity Miss Marwood was Felix Sunday School teacher and he was very fond of her But by this time Felix was quite reckless I dont care what she would say he retorted Felicity tried another tack Youll be sure to get whipped if you fight with Peter she said Youre too fat to fight After that no moral force on earth could have prevented Felix from fighting He would have faced an army with banners You might settle it by drawing lots said Cecily desperately Drawing lots is wickeder that fighting said Dan Its a kind of gambling What would Aunt Jane say if she knew you were going to fight? Cecily demanded of Peter Dont you drag my Aunt Jane into this affair said Peter darkly You said you were going to be a Presbyterian persisted Cecily Good Presbyterians dont fight Oh dont they! I heard your Uncle Roger say that Presbyterians were the best for fighting in the world--or the worst I forget which he said but it means the same thing Cecily had but one more shot in her locker I thought you said in your sermon Master Peter that people shouldnt fight I said they oughtnt to fight for fun or for bad temper retorted Peter This is different I know what Im fighting for but I cant think of the word I guess you mean principle I suggested Yes thats it agreed Peter Its all right to fight for principle Its kind of praying with your fists Oh cant you do something to prevent them from fighting Sara? pleaded Cecily turning to the Story Girl who was sitting on a bin swinging her shapely bare feet to and fro It doesnt do to meddle in an affair of this kind between boys said the Story Girl sagely I may be mistaken but I do not believe the Story Girl wanted that fight stopped And I am far from being sure that Felicity did either It was ultimately arranged that the combat should take place in the fir wood behind Uncle Rogers granary It was a nice remote bosky place where no prowling grown-up would be likely to intrude And thither we all resorted at sunset I hope Felix will beat said the Story Girl to me not only for the family honour but because that was a mean mean prayer of Peters Do you think he will? I dont know I confessed dubiously Felix is too fat Hell get out of breath in no time And Peter is such a cool customer and hes a year older than Felix But then Felix has had some practice He has fought boys in Toronto And this is Peters first fight Did you ever fight? asked the Story Girl Once I said briefly dreading the next question which promptly came Who beat? It is sometimes a bitter thing to tell the truth especially to a young lady for whom you have a great admiration I had a struggle with temptation in which I frankly confess I might have been worsted had it not been for a saving and timely remembrance of a certain resolution made on the day preceding Judgment Sunday The other fellow I said with reluctant honesty Well said the Story Girl I think it doesnt matter whether you get whipped or not so long as you fight a good square fight Her potent voice made me feel that I was quite a hero after all and the sting went out of my recollection of that old fight When we arrived behind the granary the others were all there Cecily was very pale and Felix and Peter were taking off their coats There was a pure yellow sunset that evening and the aisles of the fir wood were flooded with its radiance A cool autumnal wind was whistling among the dark boughs and scattering blood red leaves from the maple at the end of the granary Now said Dan Ill count and when I say three you pitch in and hammer each other until one of you has had enough Cecily keep quiet Now one--two--three! Peter and Felix pitched in with more zeal than discretion on both sides As a result Peter got what later developed into a black eye and Felixs nose began to bleed Cecily gave a shriek and ran out of the wood We thought she had fled because she could not endure the sight of blood and we were not sorry for her manifest disapproval and anxiety were damping the excitement of the occasion Felix and Peter drew apart after that first onset and circled about one another warily Then just as they had come to grips again Uncle Alec walked around the corner of the granary with Cecily behind him He was not angry There was a quizzical look in his eyes But he took the combatants by their shirt collars and dragged them apart This stops right here boys he said You know I dont allow fighting Oh but Uncle Alec it was this way began Felix eagerly Peter-- No I dont want to hear about it said Uncle Alec sternly I dont care what you were fighting about but you must settle your quarrels in a different fashion Remember my commands Felix Peter Roger is looking for you to wash his buggy Be off Peter went off rather sullenly and Felix also sullenly sat down and began to nurse his nose He turned his back on Cecily Cecily caught it after Uncle Alec had gone Dan called her a tell-tale and a baby and sneered at her until Cecily began to cry I couldnt stand by and watch Felix and Peter pound each other all to pieces she sobbed Theyve been such friends and it was dreadful to see them fighting Uncle Roger would have let them fight it out said the Story Girl discontentedly Uncle Roger believes in boys fighting He says its as harmless a way as any of working off their original sin Peter and Felix wouldnt have been any worse friends after it Theyd have been better friends because the praying question would have been settled And now it cant be--unless Felicity can coax Peter to give up praying against Felix For once in her life the Story Girl was not as tactful as her wont Or--is it possible that she said it out of malice prepense? At all events Felicity resented the imputation that she had more influence with Peter than any one else I dont meddle with hired boys prayers she said haughtily It was all nonsense fighting about such prayers anyhow said Dan who probably thought that since all chance of a fight was over he might as well avow his real sentiments as to its folly Just as much nonsense as praying about the bitter apples in the first place Oh Dan dont you believe there is some good in praying? said Cecily reproachfully Yes I believe theres some good in some kinds of praying but not in that kind said Dan sturdily I dont believe God cares whether anybody can eat an apple without making a face or not I dont believe its right to talk of God as if you were well acquainted with Him said Felicity who felt that it was a good chance to snub Dan Theres something wrong somewhere said Cecily perplexedly We ought to pray for what we want of that Im sure--and Peter wanted to be the only one who could pass the Ordeal It seems as if he must be right--and yet it doesnt seem so I wish I could understand it Peters prayer was wrong because it was a selfish prayer I guess said the Story Girl thoughtfully Felixs prayer was all right because it wouldnt have hurt any one else; but it was selfish of Peter to want to be the only one We mustnt pray selfish prayers Oh I see through it now said Cecily joyfully Yes but said Dan triumphantly if you believe God answers prayers about particular things it was Peters prayer He answered What do you make of that? Oh! the Story Girl shook her head impatiently Theres no use trying to make such things out We only get more mixed up all the time Lets leave it alone and Ill tell you a story Aunt Olivia had a letter today from a friend in Nova Scotia who lives in Shubenacadie When I said I thought it a funny name she told me to go and look in her scrap book and I would find a story about the origin of the name And I did Dont you want to hear it? Of course we did We all sat down at the roots of the firs Felix having finally squared matters with his nose turned around and listened also He would not look at Cecily but every one else had forgiven her The Story Girl leaned that brown head of hers against the fir trunk behind her and looked up at the apple-green sky through the dark boughs above us She wore I remember a dress of warm crimson and she had wound around her head a string of waxberries that looked like a fillet of pearls Her cheeks were still flushed with the excitement of the evening In the dim light she was beautiful with a wild mystic loveliness a compelling charm that would not be denied Many many moons ago an Indian tribe lived on the banks of a river in Nova Scotia One of the young braves was named Accadee He was the tallest and bravest and handsomest young man in the tribe-- Why is it theyre always so handsome in stories? asked Dan Why are there never no stories about ugly people? Perhaps ugly people never have stories happen to them suggested Felicity I think theyre just as interesting as the handsome people retorted Dan Well maybe they are in real life said Cecily but in stories its just as easy to make them handsome as not I like them best that way I just love to read a story where the heroine is beautiful as a dream Pretty people are always conceited said Felix who was getting tired of holding his tongue The heroes in stories are always nice said Felicity with apparent irrelevance Theyre always so tall and slender Wouldnt it be awful funny if any one wrote a story about a fat hero--or about one with too big a mouth? It doesnt matter what a man LOOKS like I said feeling that Felix and Dan were catching it rather too hotly He must be a good sort of chap and DO heaps of things Thats all thats necessary Do any of you happen to want to hear the rest of my story? asked the Story Girl in an ominously polite voice that recalled us to a sense of our bad manners We apologized and promised to behave better; she went on appeased Accadee was all these things that I have mentioned and he was the best hunter in the tribe besides Never an arrow of his that did not go straight to the mark Many and many a snow white moose he shot and gave the beautiful skin to his sweetheart Her name was Shuben and she was as lovely as the moon when it rises from the sea and as pleasant as a summer twilight Her eyes were dark and soft her foot was as light as a breeze and her voice sounded like a brook in the woods or the wind that comes over the hills at night She and Accadee were very much in love with each other and often they hunted together for Shuben was almost as skilful with her bow and arrow as Accadee himself They had loved each other ever since they were small pappooses and they had vowed to love each other as long as the river ran One twilight when Accadee was out hunting in the woods he shot a snow white moose; and he took off its skin and wrapped it around him Then he went on through the woods in the starlight; and he felt so happy and light of heart that he sometimes frisked and capered about just as a real moose would do And he was doing this when Shuben who was also out hunting saw him from afar and thought he was a real moose She stole cautiously through the woods until she came to the brink of a little valley Below her stood the snow white moose She drew her arrow to her eye--alas she knew the art only too well!--and took careful aim The next moment Accadee fell dead with her arrow in his heart The Story Girl paused--a dramatic pause It was quite dark in the fir wood We could see her face and eyes but dimly through the gloom A silvery moon was looking down on us over the granary The stars twinkled through the softly waving boughs Beyond the wood we caught a glimpse of a moonlit world lying in the sharp frost of the October evening The sky above it was chill and ethereal and mystical But all about us were shadows; and the weird little tale told in a voice fraught with mystery and pathos had peopled them for us with furtive folk in belt and wampum and dark-tressed Indian maidens What did Shuben do when she found out she had killed Accadee? asked Felicity She died of a broken heart before the spring and she and Accadee were buried side by side on the bank of the river which has ever since borne their names--the river Shubenacadie said the Story Girl The sharp wind blew around the granary and Cecily shivered We heard Aunt Janets voice calling Children children Shaking off the spell of firs and moonlight and romantic tale we scrambled to our feet and went homeward I kind of wish Id been born an Injun said Dan It must have been a jolly life--nothing to do but hunt and fight It wouldnt be so nice if they caught you and tortured you at the stake said Felicity No said Dan reluctantly I suppose thered be some drawback to everything even being an Injun Isnt it cold? said Cecily shivering again It will soon be winter I wish summer could last forever Felicity likes the winter and so does the Story Girl but I dont It always seems so long till spring Never mind weve had a splendid summer I said slipping my arm about her to comfort some childish sorrow that breathed in her plaintive voice Truly we had had a delectable summer; and having had it it was ours forever The gods themselves cannot recall their gifts They may rob us of our future and embitter our present but our past they may not touch With all its laughter and delight and glamour it is our eternal possession Nevertheless we all felt a little of the sadness of the waning year There was a distinct weight on our spirits until Felicity took us into the pantry and stayed us with apple tarts and comforted us with cream Then we brightened up It was really a very decent world after all CHAPTER XXVIII THE TALE OF THE RAINBOW BRIDGE Felix so far as my remembrance goes never attained to success in the Ordeal of Bitter Apples He gave up trying after awhile; and he also gave up praying about it saying in bitterness of spirit that there was no use in praying when other fellows prayed against you out of spite He and Peter remained on bad terms for some time however We were all of us too tired those nights to do any special praying Sometimes I fear our regular prayers were slurred over or mumbled in anything but reverent haste October was a busy month on the hill farms The apples had to be picked and this work fell mainly to us children We stayed home from school to do it It was pleasant work and there was a great deal of fun in it; but it was hard too and our arms and backs ached roundly at night In the mornings it was very delightful; in the afternoons tolerable; but in the evenings we lagged and the laughter and zest of fresher hours were lacking Some of the apples had to be picked very carefully But with others it did not matter; we boys would climb the trees and shake the apples down until the girls shrieked for mercy The days were crisp and mellow with warm sunshine and a tang of frost in the air mingled with the woodsy odours of the withering grasses The hens and turkeys prowled about pecking at windfalls and Pat made mad rushes at them amid the fallen leaves The world beyond the orchard was in a royal magnificence of colouring under the vivid blue autumn sky The big willow by the gate was a splendid golden dome and the maples that were scattered through the spruce grove waved blood-red banners over the sombre cone-bearers The Story Girl generally had her head garlanded with their leaves They became her vastly Neither Felicity nor Cecily could have worn them Those two girls were of a domestic type that assorted ill with the wildfire in Natures veins But when the Story Girl wreathed her nut brown tresses with crimson leaves it seemed as Peter said that they grew on her--as if the gold and flame of her spirit had broken out in a coronal as much a part of her as the pale halo seems a part of the Madonna it encircles What tales she told us on those far-away autumn days peopling the russet arcades with folk of an elder world Many a princess rode by us on her palfrey many a swaggering gallant ruffled it bravely in velvet and plume adown Uncle Stephens Walk many a stately lady silken clad walked in that opulent orchard! When we had filled our baskets they had to be carried to the granary loft and the contents stored in bins or spread on the floor to ripen further We ate a good many of course feeling that the labourer was worthy of his hire The apples from our own birthday trees were stored in separate barrels inscribed with our names We might dispose of them as we willed Felicity sold hers to Uncle Alecs hired man--and was badly cheated to boot for he levanted shortly afterwards taking the apples with him having paid her only half her rightful due Felicity has not gotten over that to this day Cecily dear heart sent most of hers to the hospital in town and no doubt gathered in therefrom dividends of gratitude and satisfaction of soul such as can never be purchased by any mere process of bargain and sale The rest of us ate our apples or carried them to school where we bartered them for such treasures as our schoolmates possessed and we coveted There was a dusky little pear-shaped apple--from one of Uncle Stephens trees--which was our favourite; and next to it a delicious juicy yellow apple from Aunt Louisas tree We were also fond of the big sweet apples; we used to throw them up in the air and let them fall on the ground until they were bruised and battered to the bursting point Then we sucked on the juice; sweeter was it than the nectar drunk by blissful gods on the Thessalian hill Sometimes we worked until the cold yellow sunsets faded out over the darkening distances and the hunters moon looked down on us through the sparkling air The constellations of autumn scintillated above us Peter and the Story Girl knew all about them and imparted their knowledge to us generously I recall Peter standing on the Pulpit Stone one night ere moonrise and pointing them out to us occasionally having a difference of opinion with the Story Girl over the name of some particular star Jobs Coffin and the Northern Cross were to the west of us; south of us flamed Fomalhaut The Great Square of Pegasus was over our heads Cassiopeia sat enthroned in her beautiful chair in the north-east; and north of us the Dippers swung untiringly around the Pole Star Cecily and Felix were the only ones who could distinguish the double star in the handle of the Big Dipper and greatly did they plume themselves thereon The Story Girl told us the myths and legends woven around these immemorial clusters her very voice taking on a clear remote starry sound as she talked of them When she ceased we came back to earth feeling as if we had been millions of miles away in the blue ether and that all our old familiar surroundings were momentarily forgotten and strange That night when he pointed out the stars to us from the Pulpit Stone was the last time for several weeks that Peter shared our toil and pastime The next day he complained of headache and sore throat and seemed to prefer lying on Aunt Olivias kitchen sofa to doing any work As it was not in Peter to be a malingerer he was left in peace while we picked apples Felix alone must unjustly and spitefully declared that Peter was simply shirking Hes just lazy thats whats the matter with him he said Why dont you talk sense if you must talk? said Felicity Theres no sense in calling Peter lazy You might as well say I had black hair Of course Peter being a Craig has his faults but hes a smart boy His father was lazy but his mother hasnt a lazy bone in her body and Peter takes after her Uncle Roger says Peters father wasnt exactly lazy said the Story Girl The trouble was there were so many other things he liked better than work I wonder if hell ever come back to his family said Cecily Just think how dreadful it would be if OUR father had left us like that! Our father is a King said Felicity loftily and Peters father was only a Craig A member of our family COULDNT behave like that They say there must be a black sheep in every family said the Story Girl There isnt any in ours said Cecily loyally Why do white sheep eat more than black? asked Felix Is that a conundrum? asked Cecily cautiously If it is I wont try to guess the reason I never can guess conundrums It isnt a conundrum said Felix Its a fact They do--and theres a good reason for it We stopped picking apples sat down on the grass and tried to reason it out--with the exception of Dan who declared that he knew there was a catch somewhere and he wasnt going to be caught The rest of us could not see where any catch could exist since Felix solemnly vowed cross his heart white sheep did eat more than black We argued over it seriously but finally had to give it up Well what is the reason? asked Felicity Because theres more of them said Felix grinning I forget what we did to Felix A shower came up in the evening and we had to stop picking After the shower there was a magnificent double rainbow We watched it from the granary window and the Story Girl told us an old legend culled from one of Aunt Olivias many scrapbooks Long long ago in the Golden Age when the gods used to visit the earth so often that it was nothing uncommon to see them Odin made a pilgrimage over the world Odin was the great god of the northland you know And wherever he went among men he taught them love and brotherhood and skilful arts; and great cities sprang up where he had trodden and every land through which he passed was blessed because one of the gods had come down to men But many men and women followed Odin himself giving up all their worldly possessions and ambitions; and to these he promised the gift of eternal life All these people were good and noble and unselfish and kind; but the best and noblest of them all was a youth named Ving; and this youth was beloved by Odin above all others for his beauty and strength and goodness Always he walked on Odins right hand and always the first light of Odins smile fell on him Tall and straight was he as a young pine and his long hair was the colour of ripe wheat in the sun; and his blue eyes were like the northland heavens on a starry night In Odins band was a beautiful maiden named Alin She was as fair and delicate as a young birch tree in spring among the dark old pines and firs and Ving loved her with all his heart His soul thrilled with rapture at the thought that he and she together should drink from the fountain of immortality as Odin had promised and be one thereafter in eternal youth At last they came to the very place where the rainbow touched the earth And the rainbow was a great bridge built of living colours so dazzling and wonderful that beyond it the eye could see nothing only far away a great blinding sparkling glory where the fountain of life sprang up in a shower of diamond fire But under the Rainbow Bridge rolled a terrible flood deep and wide and violent full of rocks and rapids and whirlpools There was a Warder of the bridge a god dark and stern and sorrowful And to him Odin gave command that he should open the gate and allow his followers to cross the Rainbow Bridge that they might drink of the fountain of life beyond And the Warder set open the gate Pass on and drink of the fountain he said To all who taste of it shall immortality be given But only to that one who shall drink of it first shall be permitted to walk at Odins right hand forever Then the company passed through in great haste all fired with a desire to be the first to drink of the fountain and win so marvellous a boon Last of all came Ving He had lingered behind to pluck a thorn from the foot of a beggar child he had met on the highway and he had not heard the Warders words But when eager joyous radiant he set his foot on the rainbow the stern sorrowful Warder took him by the arm and drew him back Ving strong noble and valiant he said Rainbow Bridge is not for thee Very dark grew Vings face Hot rebellion rose in his heart and rushed over his pale lips Why dost thou keep back the draught of immortality from me? he demanded passionately The Warder pointed to the dark flood that rolled under the bridge The path of the rainbow is not for thee he said but yonder way is open Ford that flood On the furthest bank is the fountain of life Thou mockest me muttered Ving sullenly No mortal could cross that flood Oh Master he prayed turning beseechingly to Odin thou didst promise to me eternal life as to the others Wilt thou not keep that promise? Command the Warder to let me pass He must obey thee But Odin stood silent with his face turned from his beloved and Vings heart was filled with unspeakable bitterness and despair Thou mayest return to earth if thou fearest to essay the flood said the Warder Nay said Ving wildly earthly life without Alin is more dreadful than the death which awaits me in yon dark river And he plunged fiercely in He swam and struggled he buffetted the turmoil The waves went over his head again and again the whirlpools caught him and flung him on the cruel rocks The wild cold spray beat on his eyes and blinded him so that he could see nothing and the roar of the river deafened him so that he could hear nothing; but he felt keenly the wounds and bruises of the cruel rocks and many a time he would have given up the struggle had not the thought of sweet Alins loving eyes brought him the strength and desire to struggle as long as it was possible Long long long to him seemed that bitter and perilous passage; but at last he won through to the furthest side Breathless and reeling his vesture torn his great wounds bleeding he found himself on the shore where the fountain of immortality sprang up He staggered to its brink and drank of its clear stream Then all pain and weariness fell away from him and he rose up a god beautiful with immortality And as he did there came rushing over the Rainbow Bridge a great company--the band of fellow travellers But all were too late to win the double boon Ving had won to it through the danger and suffering of the dark river The rainbow had faded out and the darkness of the October dusk was falling I wonder said Dan meditatively as we went away from that redolent spot what it would be like to live for ever in this world I expect wed get tired of it after awhile said the Story Girl But she added I think it would be a goodly while before I would CHAPTER XXIX THE SHADOW FEARED OF MAN We were all up early the next morning dressing by candlelight But early as it was we found the Story Girl in the kitchen when we went down sitting on Rachel Wards blue chest and looking important What do you think? she exclaimed Peter has the measles! He was dreadfully sick all night and Uncle Roger had to go for the doctor He was quite light-headed and didnt know any one Of course hes far too sick to be taken home so his mother has come up to wait on him and Im to live over here until he is better This was mingled bitter and sweet We were sorry to hear that Peter had the measles; but it would be jolly to have the Story Girl living with us all the time What orgies of story telling we should have! I suppose well all have the measles now grumbled Felicity And October is such an inconvenient time for measles--theres so much to do I dont believe any time is very convenient to have the measles Cecily said Oh perhaps we wont have them said the Story Girl cheerfully Peter caught them at Markdale the last time he was home his mother says I dont want to catch the measles from Peter said Felicity decidedly Fancy catching them from a hired boy! Oh Felicity dont call Peter a hired boy when hes sick protested Cecily During the next two days we were very busy--too busy to tell tales or listen to them Only in the frosty dusk did we have time to wander afar in realms of gold with the Story Girl She had recently been digging into a couple of old volumes of classic myths and northland folklore which she had found in Aunt Olivias attic; and for us god and goddess laughing nymph and mocking satyr norn and valkyrie elf and troll and green folk generally were real creatures once again inhabiting the orchards and woods and meadows around us until it seemed as if the Golden Age had returned to earth Then on the third day the Story Girl came to us with a very white face She had been over to Uncle Rogers yard to hear the latest bulletin from the sick room Hitherto they had been of a non-committal nature; but now it was only too evident that she had bad news Peter is very very sick she said miserably He has caught cold someway--and the measles have struck in--and--and-- the Story Girl wrung her brown hands together-- the doctor is afraid he--he--wont get better We all stood around stricken incredulous Do you mean said Felix finding voice at length that Peter is going to die? The Story Girl nodded miserably Theyre afraid so Cecily sat down by her half filled basket and began to cry Felicity said violently that she didnt believe it I cant pick another apple to-day and I aint going to try said Dan None of us could We went to the grown-ups and told them so; and the grown-ups with unaccustomed understanding and sympathy told us that we need not Then we roamed about in our wretchedness and tried to comfort one another We avoided the orchard; it was for us too full of happy memories to accord with our bitterness of soul Instead we resorted to the spruce wood where the hush and the sombre shadows and the soft melancholy sighing of the wind in the branches over us did not jar harshly on our new sorrow We could not really believe that Peter was going to die--to DIE Old people died Grown-up people died Even children of whom we had heard died But that one of US--of our merry little band--should die was unbelievable We could not believe it And yet the possibility struck us in the face like a blow We sat on the mossy stones under the dark old evergreens and gave ourselves up to wretchedness We all even Dan cried except the Story Girl I dont see how you can be so unfeeling Sara Stanley said Felicity reproachfully Youve always been such friends with Peter--and made out you thought so much of him--and now you aint shedding a tear for him I looked at the Story Girls dry piteous eyes and suddenly remembered that I had never seen her cry When she told us sad tales in a voice laden with all the tears that had ever been shed she had never shed one of her own I cant cry she said drearily I wish I could Ive a dreadful feeling here-- she touched her slender throat-- and if I could cry I think it would make it better But I cant Maybe Peter will get better after all said Dan swallowing a sob Ive heard of lots of people who went and got better after the doctor said they were going to die While theres life theres hope you know said Felix We shouldnt cross bridges till we come to them Those are only proverbs said the Story Girl bitterly Proverbs are all very fine when theres nothing to worry you but when youre in real trouble theyre not a bit of help Oh I wish Id never said Peter wasnt fit to associate with moaned Felicity If he ever gets better Ill never say such a thing again--Ill never THINK it Hes just a lovely boy and twice as smart as lots that arent hired out He was always so polite and good-natured and obliging sighed Cecily He was just a real gentleman said the Story Girl There aint many fellows as fair and square as Peter said Dan And such a worker said Felix Uncle Roger says he never had a boy he could depend on like Peter I said Its too late to be saying all these nice things about him now said the Story Girl He wont ever know how much we thought of him Its too late If he gets better Ill tell him said Cecily resolutely I wish I hadnt boxed his ears that day he tried to kiss me went on Felicity who was evidently raking her conscience for past offences in regard to Peter Of course I couldnt be expected to let a hir--to let a boy kiss me But I neednt have been so cross about it I might have been more dignified And I told him I just hated him That wasnt true but I spose hell die thinking it is Oh dear me what makes people say things theyve got to be so sorry for afterwards? I suppose if Peter d-d-dies hell go to heaven anyhow sobbed Cecily Hes been real good all this summer but he isnt a church member Hes a Presbyterian you know said Felicity reassuringly Her tone expressed her conviction that that would carry Peter through if anything would Were none of us church members But of course Peter couldnt be sent to the bad place That would be ridiculous What would they do with him there when hes so good and polite and honest and kind? Oh I think hell be all right too sighed Cecily but you know he never did go to church and Sunday School before this summer Well his father run away and his mother was too busy earning a living to bring him up right argued Felicity Dont you suppose that anybody even God would make allowances for that? Of course Peter will go to heaven said the Story Girl Hes not grown up enough to go anywhere else Children always go to heaven But I dont want him to go there or anywhere else I want him to stay right here I know heaven must be a splendid place but Im sure Peter would rather be here having fun with us Sara Stanley rebuked Felicity I should think you wouldnt say such things at such a solemn time Youre such a queer girl Wouldnt you rather be here yourself than in heaven? said the Story Girl bluntly Wouldnt you now Felicity King? Tell the truth cross your heart But Felicity took refuge from this inconvenient question in tears If we could only DO something to help Peter! I said desperately It seems dreadful not to be able to do a single thing Theres one thing we can do said Cecily gently We can pray for him So we can I agreed Im going to pray like sixty said Felix energetically Well have to be awful good you know warned Cecily Theres no use praying if youre not good That will be easy sighed Felicity I dont feel a bit like being bad If anything happens to Peter I feel sure Ill never be naughty again I wont have the heart We did indeed pray most sincerely for Peters recovery We did not as in the case of Paddy tack it on after more important things but put it in the very forefront of our petitions Even skeptical Dan prayed his skepticism falling away from him like a discarded garment in this valley of the shadow which sifts out hearts and tries souls until we all grown-up or children realize our weakness and finding that our own puny strength is as a reed shaken in the wind creep back humbly to the God we have vainly dreamed we could do without Peter was no better the next day Aunt Olivia reported that his mother was broken-hearted We did not again ask to be released from work Instead we went at it with feverish zeal If we worked hard there was less time for grief and grievious thoughts We picked apples and dragged them to the granary doggedly In the afternoon Aunt Janet brought us a lunch of apple turnovers; but we could not eat them Peter as Felicity reminded us with a burst of tears had been so fond of apple turnovers And oh how good we were! How angelically and unnaturally good! Never was there such a band of kind sweet-tempered unselfish children in any orchard Even Felicity and Dan for once in their lives got through the day without any exchange of left-handed compliments Cecily confided to me that she never meant to put her hair up in curlers on Saturday nights again because it was pretending She was so anxious to repent of something sweet girl and this was all she could think of During the afternoon Judy Pineau brought up a tear-blotted note from Sara Ray Sara had not been allowed to visit the hill farm since Peter had developed measles She was an unhappy little exile and could only relieve her anguish of soul by daily letters to Cecily which the faithful and obliging Judy Pineau brought up for her These epistles were as gushingly underlined as if Sara had been a correspondent of early Victorian days Cecily did not write back because Mrs Ray had decreed that no letters must be taken down from the hill farm lest they carry infection Cecily had offered to bake every epistle thoroughly in the oven before sending it; but Mrs Ray was inexorable and Cecily had to content herself by sending long verbal messages with Judy Pineau My OWN DEAREST Cecily ran Saras letter I have just heard the sad news about POOR DEAR PETER I cant describe MY FEELINGS They are DREADFUL I have been crying ALL THE AFTERNOON I wish I could FLY to you but ma will not let me She is afraid I will catch the measles but I would rather have the measles A DOZEN TIMES OVER than be sepparated from you all like this But I have felt ever since the Judgment Sunday that I MUST OBEY MA BETTER than I used to do If ANYTHING HAPPENS to Peter and you are let see him BEFORE IT HAPPENS give him MY LOVE and tell him HOW SORRY I AM and that I hope we will ALL meet in A BETTER WORLD Everything in school is about the same The master is awful cross by spells Jimmy Frewen walked home with Nellie Bowan last night from prayer-meeting and HER ONLY FOURTEEN Dont you think it horrid BEGINNING SO YOUNG? YOU AND ME would NEVER do anything like that till we were GROWN UP would we? Willy Fraser looks SO LONESOME in school these days I must stop for ma says I waste FAR TOO MUCH TIME writing letters Tell Judy ALL THE NEWS for me Your OWN TRUE FRIEND SARA RAY PS Oh I DO hope Peter will get better Ma is going to get me a new brown dress for the winter S R When evening came we went to our seats under the whispering sighing fir trees It was a beautiful night--clear windless frosty Some one galloped down the road on horseback lustily singing a comic song How dared he? We felt that it was an insult to our wretchedness If Peter were going to--going to--well if anything happened to Peter we felt so miserably sure that the music of life would be stilled for us for ever How could any one in the world be happy when we were so unhappy? Presently Aunt Olivia came down the long twilight arcade Her bright hair was uncovered and she looked slim and queen-like in her light dress We thought Aunt Olivia very pretty then Looking back from a mature standpoint I realize that she must have been an unusually beautiful woman; and she looked her prettiest as she stood under the swaying boughs in the last faint light of the autumn dusk and smiled down at our woebegone faces Dear sorrowful little people I bring you glad tidings of great joy she said The doctor has just been here and he finds Peter much better and thinks he will pull through after all We gazed up at her in silence for a few moments When we had heard the news of Paddys recovery we had been noisy and jubilant; but we were very quiet now We had been too near something dark and terrible and menacing; and though it was thus suddenly removed the chill and shadow of it were about us still Presently the Story Girl who had been standing up leaning against a tall fir slipped down to the ground in a huddled fashion and broke into a very passion of weeping I had never heard any one cry so with dreadful rending sobs I was used to hearing girls cry It was as much Sara Rays normal state as any other and even Felicity and Cecily availed themselves occasionally of the privilege of sex But I had never heard any girl cry like this It gave me the same unpleasant sensation which I had felt one time when I had seen my father cry Oh dont Sara dont I said gently patting her convulsed shoulder You ARE a queer girl said Felicity--more tolerantly than usual however-- you never cried a speck when you thought Peter was going to die--and now when he is going to get better you cry like that Sara child come with me said Aunt Olivia bending over her The Story Girl got up and went away with Aunt Olivias arms around her The sound of her crying died away under the firs and with it seemed to go the dread and grief that had been our portion for hours In the reaction our spirits rose with a bound Oh aint it great that Peters going to be all right? said Dan springing up I never was so glad of anything in my whole life declared Felicity in shameless rapture Cant we send word somehow to Sara Ray to-night? asked Cecily the ever-thoughtful Shes feeling so bad--and shell have to feel that way till to-morrow if we cant Lets all go down to the Ray gate and holler to Judy Pineau till she comes out suggested Felix Accordingly we went and hollered with a right good will We were much taken aback to find that Mrs Ray came to the gate instead of Judy and rather sourly demanded what we were yelling about When she heard our news however she had the decency to say she was glad and to promise she would convey the good tidings to Sara-- who is already in bed where all children of her age should be added Mrs Ray severely WE had no intention of going to bed for a good two hours yet Instead after devoutly thanking goodness that our grown-ups in spite of some imperfections were not of the Mrs Ray type we betook ourselves to the granary lighted a huge lantern which Dan had made out of a turnip and proceeded to devour all the apples we might have eaten through the day but had not We were a blithe little crew sitting there in the light of our goblin lantern We had in very truth been given beauty for ashes and the oil of joy for mourning Life was as a red rose once more Im going to make a big batch of patty-pans first thing in the morning said Felicity jubilantly Isnt it queer? Last night I felt just like praying and tonight I feel just like cooking We mustnt forget to thank God for making Peter better said Cecily as we finally went to the house Do you spose Peter wouldnt have got better anyway? said Dan Oh Dan what makes you ask such questions? exclaimed Cecily in real distress I dunno said Dan They just kind of come into my head like But of course I mean to thank God when I say my prayers to-night Thats only decent CHAPTER XXX A COMPOUND LETTER Once Peter was out of danger he recovered rapidly but he found his convalescence rather tedious; and Aunt Olivia suggested to us one day that we write a compound letter to amuse him until he could come to the window and talk to us from a safe distance The idea appealed to us; and the day being Saturday and the apples all picked we betook ourselves to the orchard to compose our epistles Cecily having first sent word by a convenient caller to Sara Ray that she too might have a letter ready Later I having at that time a mania for preserving all documents relating to our life in Carlisle copied those letters in the blank pages at the back of my dream book Hence I can reproduce them verbatim with the bouquet they have retained through all the long years since they were penned in that autumnal orchard on the hill with its fading leaves and frosted grasses and the mild delightsome melancholy of the late October day enfolding CECILYS LETTER DEAR PETER--I am so very glad and thankful that you are going to get better We were so afraid you would not last Tuesday and we felt dreadful even Felicity We all prayed for you I think the others have stopped now but I keep it up every night still for fear you might have a relaps (I dont know if that is spelled right I havent the dixonary handy and if I ask the others Felicity will laugh at me though she cannot spell lots of words herself) I am saving some of the Honourable Mr Whalens pears for you Ive got them hid where nobody can find them Theres only a dozen because Dan et all the rest but I guess you will like them We have got all the apples picked and are all ready to take the measles now if we have to but I hope we wont If we have to though Id rather catch them from you than from any one else because we are acquainted with you If I do take the measles and anything happens to me Felicity is to have my cherry vase Id rather give it to the Story Girl but Dan says it ought to be kept in the family even if Felicity is a crank I havent anything else valuable since I gave Sara Ray my forget-me-not jug but if you would like anything Ive got let me know and Ill leave instructions for you to have it The Story Girl has told us some splendid stories lately I wish I was clever like her Ma says it doesnt matter if youre not clever as long as you are good but I am not even very good I think this is all my news except that I want to tell you how much we all think of you Peter When we heard you were sick we all said nice things about you but we were afraid it was too late and I said if you got better Id tell you It is easier to write it than to tell it out to your face We think you are smart and polite and obliging and a great worker and a gentleman Your true friend CECILY KING PS If you answer my letter dont say anything about the pears because I dont want Dan to find out theres any left C K FELICITYS LETTER DEAR PETER--Aunt Olivia says for us all to write a compound letter to cheer you up We are all awful glad you are getting better It gave us an awful scare when we heard you were going to die But you will soon be all right and able to get out again Be careful you dont catch cold I am going to bake some nice things for you and send them over now that the doctor says you can eat them And Ill send you my rosebud plate to eat off of Im only lending it you know not giving it I let very few people use it because it is my greatest treasure Mind you dont break it Aunt Olivia must always wash it not your mother I do hope the rest of us wont catch the measles It must look horrid to have red spots all over your face We all feel pretty well yet The Story Girl says as many queer things as ever Felix thinks he is getting thin but he is fatter than ever and no wonder with all the apples he eats He has give up trying to eat the bitter apples at last Beverley has grown half an inch since July by the mark on the hall door and he is awful pleased about it I told him I guessed the magic seed was taking effect at last and he got mad He never gets mad at anything the Story Girl says and yet she is so sarkastic by times Dan is pretty hard to get along with as usul but I try to bear pashently with him Cecily is well and says she isnt going to curl her hair any more She is so conscienshus I am glad my hair curls of itself aint you? We havent seen Sara Ray since you got sick She is awful lonesome and Judy says she cries nearly all the time but that is nothing new Im awful sorry for Sara but Im glad Im not her She is going to write you a letter too Youll let me see what she puts in it wont you? Youd better take some Mexican Tea now Its a great blood purifyer I am going to get a lovely dark blue dress for the winter It is ever so much prettier than Sara Rays brown one Sara Rays mother has no taste The Story Girls father is sending her a new red dress and a red velvet cap from Paris She is so fond of red I cant bear it it looks so common Mother says I can get a velvet hood too Cecily says she doesnt believe its right to wear velvet when its so expensive and the heathen are crying for the gospel She got that idea from a Sunday School paper but I am going to get my hood all the same Well Peter I have no more news so I will close for this time hoping you will soon be quite well I remain yours sincerely FELICITY KING PS The Story Girl peeked over my shoulder and says I ought to have signed it yours affeckshunately but I know better because the _Family Guide_ has told lots of times how you should sign yourself when you are writing to a young man who is only a friend F K FELIX LETTER DEAR PETER--I am awful glad you are getting better We all felt bad when we thought you wouldnt but I felt worse than the others because we hadnt been on very good terms lately and I had said mean things about you Im sorry and Peter you can pray for anything you like and I wont ever object again Im glad Uncle Alec interfered and stopped the fight If I had licked you and you had died of the measles it would have been a dreadful thing We have all the apples in and havent much to do just now and we are having lots of fun but we wish you were here to join in Im a lot thinner than I was I guess working so hard picking apples is a good thing to make you thin The girls are all well Felicity puts on as many airs as ever but she makes great things to eat I have had some splendid dreams since we gave up writing them down That is always the way We aint going to school till were sure we are not going to have the measles This is all I can think of so I will draw to a close Remember you can pray for anything you like FELIX KING SARA RAYS LETTER DEAR PETER--I never wrote to A BOY before so PLEASE excuse ALL mistakes I am SO glad you are getting better We were SO afraid you were GOING TO DIE I CRIED ALL NIGHT about it But now that you are OUT OF DANGER will you tell me WHAT IT REALLY FEELS LIKE to think you are going to die? Does it FEEL QUEER? Were you VERY badly frightened? Ma wont let me go up the hill AT ALL now I would DIE if it was not for Judy Pinno (The French names are SO HARD TO SPELL) JUDY IS VERY OBLIGING and I feel that she SIMPATHISES WITH ME In my LONELY HOURS I read my dream book and Cecilys old letters and they are SUCH A COMFORT to me I have been reading one of the school library books too I is PRETTY GOOD but I wish they had got more LOVE STORIES because they are so exciting But the master would not let them If you had DIED Peter and YOUR FATHER had heard it wouldnt he have FELT DREADFUL? We are having BEAUTIFUL WEATHER and the seenary is fine since the leaves turned I think there is nothing so pretty as Nature after all I hope ALL DANGER from the measles will soon be over and we can ALL MEET AGAIN AT THE HOME ON THE HILL Till then FAREWELL Your true friend SARA RAY P S Dont let Felicity see this letter S R DANS LETTER DEAR OLD PETE--Awful glad you cheated the doctor I thought you werent the kind to turn up your toes so easy You should of heard the girls crying Theyre all getting their winter finery now and the talk about it would make you sick The Story Girl is getting hers from Paris and Felicity is awful jealous though she pretends she isnt I can see through her Kitt Mar was up here Thursday to see the girls Shes had the measles so she isnt scared Shes a great girl to laugh I like a girl that laughs dont you? We had a call from Peg Bowen yesterday You should of seen the Story Girl hustling Pat out of the way for all she says she dont believe he was bewitched Peg had your rheumatism ring on and the Story Girls blue beads and Sara Rays lace soed across the front of her dress She wanted some tobacco and some pickles Ma gave her some pickles but said we didnt have no tobacco and Peg went off mad but I guess she wouldnt bewitch anything on account of the pickles I aint any hand to write letters so I guess Ill stop Hope youll be out soon DAN THE STORY GIRLS LETTER DEAR PETER--Oh how glad I am that you are getting better! Those days when we thought you wouldnt were the hardest of my whole life It seemed too dreadful to be true that perhaps you would die And then when we heard you were going to get better that seemed too good to be true Oh Peter hurry up and get well for we are having such good times and we miss you so much I have coaxed Uncle Alec not to burn his potato stalks till you are well because I remember how you always liked to see the potato stalks burn Uncle Alec consented though Aunt Janet said it was high time they were burned Uncle Roger burned his last night and it was such fun Pat is splendid He has never had a sick spell since that bad one I would send him over to be company for you but Aunt Janet says no because he might carry the measles back I dont see how he could but we must obey Aunt Janet She is very good to us all but I know she does not approve of me She says Im my fathers own child I know that doesnt mean anything complimentary because she looked so queer when she saw that I had heard her but I dont care Im glad Im like father I had a splendid letter from him this week with the darlingest pictures in it He is painting a new picture which is going to make him famous I wonder what Aunt Janet will say then Do you know Peter yesterday I thought I saw the Family Ghost at last I was coming through the gap in the hedge and I saw somebody in blue standing under Uncle Alecs tree How my heart beat! My hair should have stood up on end with terror but it didnt I felt to see and it was lying down quite flat But it was only a visitor after all I dont know whether I was glad or disappointed I dont think it would be a pleasant experience to see the ghost But after I had seen it think what a heroine I would be! Oh Peter what do you think? I have got acquainted with the Awkward Man at last I never thought it would be so easy Yesterday Aunt Olivia wanted some ferns so I went back to the maple woods to get them for her and I found some lovely ones by the spring And while I was sitting there looking into the spring who should come along but the Awkward Man himself He sat right down beside me and began to talk I never was so surprised in my life We had a very interesting talk and I told him two of my best stories and a great many of my secrets into the bargain They may say what they like but he was not one bit shy or awkward and he has beautiful eyes He did not tell me any of his secrets but I believe he will some day Of course I never said a word about his Alice-room But I gave him a hint about his little brown book I said I loved poetry and often felt like writing it and then I said Do you ever feel like that Mr Dale? He said yes he sometimes felt that way but he did not mention the brown book I thought he might have But after all I dont like people who tell you everything the first time you meet them like Sara Ray When he went away he said I hope I shall have the pleasure of meeting you again just as seriously and politely as if I was a grown-up young lady I am sure he could never have said it if I had been really grown up I told him it was likely he would and that he wasnt to mind if I had a longer skirt on next time because Id be just the same person I told the children a beautiful new fairy story to-day I made them go to the spruce wood to hear it A spruce wood is the proper place to tell fairy stories in Felicity says she cant see that it makes any difference where you tell them but oh it does I wish you had been there to hear it too but when you are well I will tell it over again for you I am going to call the southernwood appleringie after this Beverley says that is what they call it in Scotland and I think it sounds so much more poetical than southernwood Felicity says the right name is Boys Love but I think that sounds silly Oh Peter shadows are such pretty things The orchard is full of them this very minute Sometimes they are so still you would think them asleep Then they go laughing and skipping Outside in the oat field they are always chasing each other They are the wild shadows The shadows in the orchard are the tame shadows Everything seems to be rather tired growing except the spruces and chrysanthemums in Aunt Olivias garden The sunshine is so thick and yellow and lazy and the crickets sing all day long The birds are nearly all gone and most of the maple leaves have fallen Just to make you laugh Ill write you a little story I heard Uncle Alec telling last night It was about Elder Frewens grandfather taking a pair of rope reins to lead a piano home Everybody laughed except Aunt Janet Old Mr Frewen was HER grandfather too and she wouldnt laugh One day when old Mr Frewen was a young man of eighteen his father came home and said Sandy I bought a piano at Simon Wards sale to-day Youre to go to-morrow and bring it home So next day Sandy started off on horseback with a pair of rope reins to lead the piano home He thought it was some kind of livestock And then Uncle Roger told about old Mark Ward who got up to make a speech at a church missionary social when he was drunk (Of course he didnt get drunk at the social He went there that way) And this was his speech Ladies and gentlemen Mr Chairman I cant express my thoughts on this grand subject of missions Its in this poor human critter--patting himself on the breast--but he cant git it out Ill tell you these stories when you get well I can tell them ever so much better than I can write them I know Felicity is wondering why Im writing such a long letter so perhaps Id better stop If your mother reads it to you there is a good deal of it she may not understand but I think your Aunt Jane would I remain your very affectionate friend SARA STANLEY I did not keep a copy of my own letter and I have forgotten everything that was in it except the first sentence in which I told Peter I was awful glad he was getting better Peters delight on receiving our letters knew no bounds He insisted on answering them and his letter painstakingly disinfected was duly delivered to us Aunt Olivia had written it at his dictation which was a gain as far as spelling and punctuation went But Peters individuality seemed merged and lost in Aunt Olivias big dashing script Not until the Story Girl read the letter to us in the granary by jack-o-lantern light in a mimicry of Peters very voice did we savour the real bouquet of it PETERS LETTER DEAR EVERYBODY BUT ESPECIALLY FELICITY--I was awful glad to get your letters It makes you real important to be sick but the time seems awful long when youre getting better Your letters were all great but I liked Felicitys best and next to hers the Story Girls Felicity it will be awful good of you to send me things to eat and the rosebud plate Ill be awful careful of it I hope you wont catch the measles for they are not nice especially when they strike in but you would look all right even if you did have red spots on your face I would like to try the Mexican Tea because you want me to but mother says no she doesnt believe in it and Burtons Bitters are a great deal healthier If I was you I would get the velvet hood all right The heathen live in warm countries so they dont want hoods Im glad you are still praying for me Cecily for you cant trust the measles And Im glad youre keeping you know what for me I dont believe anything will happen to you if you do take the measles; but if anything does Id like that little red book of yours _The Safe Compass_ just to remember you by Its such a good book to read on Sundays It is interesting and religious too So is the Bible I hadnt quite finished the Bible before I took the measles but ma is reading the last chapters to me Theres an awful lot in that book I cant understand the whole of it since Im only a hired boy but some parts are real easy Im awful glad you have such a good opinion of me I dont deserve it but after this Ill try to I cant tell you how I feel about all your kindness Im like the fellow the Story Girl wrote about who couldnt get it out I have the picture the Story Girl gave me for my sermon on the wall at the foot of my bed I like to look at it it looks so much like Aunt Jane Felix Ive given up praying that Id be the only one to eat the bitter apples and Ill never pray for anything like that again It was a horrid mean prayer I didnt know it then but after the measles struck in I found out it was Aunt Jane wouldnt have liked it After this Im going to pray prayers I neednt be ashamed of Sara Ray I dont know what it feels like to be going to die because I didnt know I was going to die till I got better Mother says I was luny most of the time after they struck in It was just because they struck in I was luny I aint luny naturally Felicity I will do what you asked in your postscript Sara although it will be hard Im glad Peg Bowen didnt catch you Dan Maybe she bewitched me that night we were at her place and that is why the measles struck in Im awful glad Mr King is going to leave the potato stalks until I get well and Im obliged to the Story Girl for coaxing him I guess she will find out about Alice yet There were some parts of her letter I couldnt see through but when the measles strike in they leave you stupid for a spell Anyhow it was a fine letter and they were all fine and Im awful glad I have so many nice friends even if I am only a hired boy Perhaps Id never have found it out if the measles hadnt struck in So Im glad they did but I hope they never will again Your obedient servant PETER CRAIG CHAPTER XXXI ON THE EDGE OF LIGHT AND DARK We celebrated the November day when Peter was permitted to rejoin us by a picnic in the orchard Sara Ray was also allowed to come under protest; and her joy over being among us once more was almost pathetic She and Cecily cried in one anothers arms as if they had been parted for years We had a beautiful day for our picnic November dreamed that it was May The air was soft and mellow with pale aerial mists in the valleys and over the leafless beeches on the western hill The sere stubble fields brooded in glamour and the sky was pearly blue The leaves were still thick on the apple trees though they were russet hued and the after-growth of grass was richly green unharmed as yet by the nipping frosts of previous nights The wind made a sweet drowsy murmur in the boughs as of bees among apple blossoms Its just like spring isnt it? asked Felicity The Story Girl shook her head No not quite It looks like spring but it isnt spring Its as if everything was resting--getting ready to sleep In spring theyre getting ready to grow Cant you FEEL the difference? I think its just like spring insisted Felicity In the sun-sweet place before the Pulpit Stone we boys had put up a board table Aunt Janet allowed us to cover it with an old tablecloth the worn places in which the girls artfully concealed with frost-whitened ferns We had the kitchen dishes and the table was gaily decorated with Cecilys three scarlet geraniums and maple leaves in the cherry vase As for the viands they were fit for the gods on high Olympus Felicity had spent the whole previous day and the forenoon of the picnic day in concocting them Her crowning achievement was a rich little plum cake on the white frosting of which the words Welcome Back were lettered in pink candies This was put before Peters place and almost overcame him To think that youd go to so much trouble for me! he said with a glance of adoring gratitude at Felicity Felicity got all the gratitude although the Story Girl had originated the idea and seeded the raisins and beaten the eggs while Cecily had trudged all the way to Mrs Jamesons little shop below the church to buy the pink candies But that is the way of the world We ought to have grace said Felicity as we sat down at the festal board Will any one say it? She looked at me but I blushed to the roots of my hair and shook my head sheepishly An awkward pause ensued; it looked as if we would have to proceed without grace when Felix suddenly shut his eyes bent his head and said a very good grace without any appearance of embarrassment We looked at him when it was over with an increase of respect Where on earth did you learn that Felix? I asked Its the grace Uncle Alec says at every meal answered Felix We felt rather ashamed of ourselves Was it possible that we had paid so little attention to Uncle Alecs grace that we did not recognize it when we heard it on other lips? Now said Felicity jubilantly lets eat everything up In truth it was a merry little feast We had gone without our dinners in order to save our appetites and we did ample justice to Felicitys good things Paddy sat on the Pulpit Stone and watched us with great yellow eyes knowing that tidbits would come his way later on Many witty things were said--or at least we thought them witty--and uproarious was the laughter Never had the old King orchard known a blither merrymaking or lighter hearts The picnic over we played games until the early falling dusk and then we went with Uncle Alec to the back field to burn the potato stalks--the crowning delight of the day The stalks were in heaps all over the field and we were allowed the privilege of setting fire to them Twas glorious! In a few minutes the field was alight with blazing bonfires over which rolled great pungent clouds of smoke From pile to pile we ran shrieking with delight to poke each up with a long stick and watch the gush of rose-red sparks stream off into the night In what a whirl of smoke and firelight and wild fantastic hurtling shadows we were! When we grew tired of our sport we went to the windward side of the field and perched ourselves on the high pole fence that skirted a dark spruce wood full of strange furtive sounds Over us was a great dark sky blossoming with silver stars and all around lay dusky mysterious reaches of meadow and wood in the soft empurpled night Away to the east a shimmering silveryness beneath a palace of aerial cloud foretokened moonrise But directly before us the potato field with its wreathing smoke and sullen flames the gigantic shadow of Uncle Alec crossing and recrossing it reminded us of Peters famous description of the bad place and probably suggested the Story Girls remark I know a story she said infusing just the right shade of weirdness into her voice about a man who saw the devil Now whats the matter Felicity? I can never get used to the way you mention the--the--that name complained Felicity To hear you speak of the Old Scratch any one would think he was just a common person Never mind Tell us the story I said curiously It is about Mrs John Martins uncle at Markdale said the Story Girl I heard Uncle Roger telling it the other night He didnt know I was sitting on the cellar hatch outside the window or I dont suppose he would have told it Mrs Martins uncles name was William Cowan and he has been dead for twenty years; but sixty years ago he was a young man and a very wild wicked young man He did everything bad he could think of and never went to church and he laughed at everything religious even the devil He didnt believe there was a devil at all One beautiful summer Sunday evening his mother pleaded with him to go to church with her but he would not He told her that he was going fishing instead and when church time came he swaggered past the church with his fishing rod over his shoulder singing a godless song Half way between the church and the harbour there was a thick spruce wood and the path ran through it When William Cowan was half way through it SOMETHING came out of the wood and walked beside him I have never heard anything more horribly suggestive than that innocent word something as enunciated by the Story Girl I felt Cecilys hand icy cold clutching mine What--what--was IT like? whispered Felix curiosity getting the better of his terror IT was tall and black and hairy said the Story Girl her eyes glowing with uncanny intensity in the red glare of the fires and IT lifted one great hairy hand with claws on the end of it and clapped William Cowan first on one shoulder and then on the other and said Good sport to you brother William Cowan gave a horrible scream and fell on his face right there in the wood Some of the men around the church door heard the scream and they rushed down to the wood They saw nothing but William Cowan lying like a dead man on the path They took him up and carried him home; and when they undressed him to put him to bed there on each shoulder was the mark of a big hand BURNED INTO THE FLESH It was weeks before the burns healed and the scars never went away Always as long as William Cowan lived he carried on his shoulders the prints of the devils hand I really do not know how we should ever have got home had we been left to our own devices We were cold with fright How could we turn our backs on the eerie spruce wood out of which SOMETHING might pop at any moment? How cross those long shadowy fields between us and our rooftree? How venture through the darkly mysterious bracken hollow? Fortunately Uncle Alec came along at this crisis and said he thought wed better come home now since the fires were nearly out We slid down from the fence and started taking care to keep close together and in front of Uncle Alec I dont believe a word of that yarn said Dan trying to speak with his usual incredulity I dont see how you can help believing it said Cecily It isnt as if it was something wed read of or that happened far away It happened just down at Markdale and Ive seen that very spruce wood myself Oh I suppose William Cowan got a fright of some kind conceded Dan but I dont believe he saw the devil Old Mr Morrison at Lower Markdale was one of the men who undressed him and he remembers seeing the marks said the Story Girl triumphantly How did William Cowan behave afterwards? I asked He was a changed man said the Story Girl solemnly Too much changed He never was known to laugh again or even smile He became a very religious man which was a good thing but he was dreadfully gloomy and thought everything pleasant sinful He wouldnt even eat any more than was actually necessary to keep him alive Uncle Roger says that if he had been a Roman Catholic he would have become a monk but as he was a Presbyterian all he could do was to turn into a crank Yes but your Uncle Roger was never clapped on the shoulder and called brother by the devil said Peter If he had he mightnt have been so precious jolly afterwards himself I do wish to goodness said Felicity in exasperation that youd stop talking of the--the--of such subjects in the dark Im so scared now that I keep thinking fathers steps behind us are SOMETHINGS Just think my own father! The Story Girl slipped her arm through Felicitys Never mind she said soothingly Ill tell you another story--such a beautiful story that youll forget all about the devil She told us one of Hans Andersens most exquisite tales; and the magic of her voice charmed away all our fear so that when we reached the bracken hollow a lake of shadow surrounded by the silver shore of moonlit fields we all went through it without a thought of His Satanic Majesty at all And beyond us on the hill the homelight was glowing from the farmhouse window like a beacon of old loves CHAPTER XXXII THE OPENING OF THE BLUE CHEST November wakened from her dream of May in a bad temper The day after the picnic a cold autumn rain set in and we got up to find our world a drenched wind-writhen place with sodden fields and dour skies The rain was weeping on the roof as if it were shedding the tears of old sorrows; the willow by the gate tossed its gaunt branches wildly as if it were some passionate spectral thing wringing its fleshless hands in agony; the orchard was haggard and uncomely; nothing seemed the same except the staunch trusty old spruces It was Friday but we were not to begin going to school again until Monday so we spent the day in the granary sorting apples and hearing tales In the evening the rain ceased the wind came around to the northwest freezing suddenly and a chilly yellow sunset beyond the dark hills seemed to herald a brighter morrow Felicity and the Story Girl and I walked down to the post-office for the mail along a road where fallen leaves went eddying fitfully up and down before us in weird uncanny dances of their own The evening was full of eerie sounds--the creaking of fir boughs the whistle of the wind in the tree-tops the vibrations of strips of dried bark on the rail fences But we carried summer and sunshine in our hearts and the bleak unloveliness of the outer world only intensified our inner radiance Felicity wore her new velvet hood with a coquettish little collar of white fur about her neck Her golden curls framed her lovely face and the wind stung the pink of her cheeks to crimson On my left hand walked the Story Girl her red cap on her jaunty brown head She scattered her words along the path like the pearls and diamonds of the old fairy tale I remember that I strutted along quite insufferably for we met several of the Carlisle boys and I felt that I was an exceptionally lucky fellow to have such beauty on one side and such charm on the other There was one of fathers thin letters for Felix a fat foreign letter for the Story Girl addressed in her fathers minute handwriting a drop letter for Cecily from some school friend with In Haste written across the corner and a letter for Aunt Janet postmarked Montreal I cant think who that is from said Felicity Nobody in Montreal ever writes to mother Cecilys letter is from Em Frewen She always puts In Haste on her letters no matter what is in them When we reached home Aunt Janet opened and read her Montreal letter Then she laid it down and looked about her in astonishment Well did ever any mortal! she said What in the world is the matter? said Uncle Alec This letter is from James Wards wife in Montreal said Aunt Janet solemnly Rachel Ward is dead And she told James wife to write to me and tell me to open the old blue chest Hurrah! shouted Dan Donald King said his mother severely Rachel Ward was your relation and she is dead What do you mean by such behaviour? I never was acquainted with her said Dan sulkily And I wasnt hurrahing because she is dead I hurrahed because that blue chest is to be opened at last So poor Rachel is gone said Uncle Alec She must have been an old woman--seventy-five I suppose I remember her as a fine blooming young woman Well well and so the old chest is to be opened at last What is to be done with its contents? Rachel left instructions about them answered Aunt Janet referring to the letter The wedding dress and veil and letters are to be burned There are two jugs in it which are to be sent to James wife The rest of the things are to be given around among the connection Each members is to have one to remember her by Oh cant we open it right away this very night? said Felicity eagerly No indeed! Aunt Janet folded up the letter decidedly That chest has been locked up for fifty years and itll stand being locked up one more night You children wouldnt sleep a wink to-night if we opened it now Youd go wild with excitement Im sure I wont sleep anyhow said Felicity Well at least youll open it the first thing in the morning wont you ma? No Ill do nothing of the sort was Aunt Janets pitiless decree I want to get the work out of the way first--and Roger and Olivia will want to be here too Well say ten oclock to-morrow forenoon Thats sixteen whole hours yet sighed Felicity Im going right over to tell the Story Girl said Cecily Wont she be excited! We were all excited We spent the evening speculating on the possible contents of the chest and Cecily dreamed miserably that night that the moths had eaten everything in it The morning dawned on a beautiful world A very slight fall of snow had come in the night--just enough to look like a filmy veil of lace flung over the dark evergreens and the hard frozen ground A new blossom time seemed to have revisited the orchard The spruce wood behind the house appeared to be woven out of enchantment There is nothing more beautiful than a thickly growing wood of firs lightly powdered with new-fallen snow As the sun remained hidden by gray clouds this fairy-beauty lasted all day The Story Girl came over early in the morning and Sara Ray to whom faithful Cecily had sent word was also on hand Felicity did not approve of this Sara Ray isnt any relation to our family she scolded to Cecily and she has no right to be present Shes a particular friend of mine said Cecily with dignity We have her in everything and it would hurt her feelings dreadfully to be left out of this Peter is no relation either but he is going to be here when we open it so why shouldnt Sara? Peter aint a member of the family YET but maybe he will be some day Hey Felicity? said Dan Youre awful smart arent you Dan King? said Felicity reddening Perhaps youd like to send for Kitty Marr too--though she DOES laugh at your big mouth It seems as if ten oclock would never come sighed the Story Girl The work is all done and Aunt Olivia and Uncle Roger are here and the chest might just as well be opened right away Mother SAID ten oclock and shell stick to it said Felicity crossly Its only nine now Let us put the clock on half an hour said the Story Girl The clock in the hall isnt going so no one will know the difference We all looked at each other I wouldnt dare said Felicity irresolutely Oh if thats all Ill do it said the Story Girl When ten oclock struck Aunt Janet came into the kitchen remarking innocently that it hadnt seemed anytime since nine We must have looked horribly guilty but none of the grown-ups suspected anything Uncle Alec brought in the axe and pried off the cover of the old blue chest while everybody stood around in silence Then came the unpacking It was certainly an interesting performance Aunt Janet and Aunt Olivia took everything out and laid it on the kitchen table We children were forbidden to touch anything but fortunately we were not forbidden the use of our eyes and tongues There are the pink and gold vases Grandmother King gave her said Felicity as Aunt Olivia unwrapped from their tissue paper swathings a pair of slender old-fashioned twisted vases of pink glass over which little gold leaves were scattered Arent they handsome? And oh exclaimed Cecily in delight theres the china fruit basket with the apple on the handle Doesnt it look real? Ive thought so much about it Oh mother please let me hold it for a minute Ill be as careful as careful There comes the china set Grandfather King gave her said the Story Girl wistfully Oh it makes me feel sad Think of all the hopes that Rachel Ward must have put away in this chest with all her pretty things Following these came a quaint little candlestick of blue china and the two jugs which were to be sent to James wife They ARE handsome said Aunt Janet rather enviously They must be a hundred years old Aunt Sara Ward gave them to Rachel and she had them for at least fifty years I should have thought one would have been enough for James wife But of course we must do just as Rachel wished I declare heres a dozen tin patty pans! Tin patty pans arent very romantic said the Story Girl discontentedly I notice that you are as fond as any one of what is baked in them said Aunt Janet Ive heard of those patty pans An old servant Grandmother King had gave them to Rachel Now we are coming to the linen That was Uncle Edward Wards present How yellow it has grown We children were not greatly interested in the sheets and tablecloths and pillow-cases which now came out of the capacious depths of the old blue chest But Aunt Olivia was quite enraptured over them What sewing! she said Look Janet youd almost need a magnifying glass to see the stitches And the dear old-fashioned pillow-slips with buttons on them! Here are a dozen handkerchiefs said Aunt Janet Look at the initial in the corner of each Rachel learned that stitch from a nun in Montreal It looks as if it was woven into the material Here are her quilts said Aunt Olivia Yes there is the blue and white counterpane Grandmother Ward gave her--and the Rising Sun quilt her Aunt Nancy made for her--and the braided rug The colours are not faded one bit I want that rug Janet Underneath the linen were Rachel Wards wedding clothes The excitement of the girls waxed red hot over these There was a Paisley shawl in the wrappings in which it had come from the store and a wide scarf of some yellowed lace There was the embroidered petticoat which had cost Felicity such painful blushes and a dozen beautifully worked sets of the fine muslin undersleeves which had been the fashion in Rachel Wards youth This was to have been her appearing out dress said Aunt Olivia lifting out a shot green silk It is all cut to pieces--but what a pretty soft shade it was! Look at the skirt Janet How many yards must it measure around? Hoopskirts were in then said Aunt Janet I dont see her wedding hat here I was always told that she packed it away too So was I But she couldnt have It certainly isnt here I have heard that the white plume on it cost a small fortune Here is her black silk mantle It seems like sacrilege to meddle with these clothes Dont be foolish Olivia They must be unpacked at least And they must all be burned since they have cut so badly This purple cloth dress is quite good however It can be made over nicely and it would become you very well Olivia No thank you said Aunt Olivia with a little shudder I should feel like a ghost Make it over for yourself Janet Well I will if you dont want it I am not troubled with fancies That seems to be all except this box I suppose the wedding dress is in it Oh breathed the girls crowding about Aunt Olivia as she lifted out the box and cut the cord around it Inside was lying a dress of soft silk that had once been white but was now yellowed with age and enfolding it like a mist a long white bridal veil redolent with some strange old-time perfume that had kept its sweetness through all the years Poor Rachel Ward said Aunt Olivia softly Here is her point lace handkerchief She made it herself It is like a spiders web Here are the letters Will Montague wrote her And here she added taking up a crimson velvet case with a tarnished gilt clasp are their photographs--his and hers We looked eagerly at the daguerreotypes in the old case Why Rachel Ward wasnt a bit pretty! exclaimed the Story Girl in poignant disappointment No Rachel Ward was not pretty that had to be admitted The picture showed a fresh young face with strongly marked irregular features large black eyes and black curls hanging around the shoulders in old-time style Rachel wasnt pretty said Uncle Alec but she had a lovely colour and a beautiful smile She looks far too sober in that picture She has a beautiful neck and bust said Aunt Olivia critically Anyhow Will Montague was really handsome said the Story Girl A handsome rogue growled Uncle Alec I never liked him I was only a little chap of ten but I saw through him Rachel Ward was far too good for him We would dearly have liked to get a peep into the letters too But Aunt Olivia would not allow that They must be burned unread she declared She took the wedding dress and veil the picture case and the letters away with her The rest of the things were put back into the chest pending their ultimate distribution Aunt Janet gave each of us boys a handkerchief The Story Girl got the blue candlestick and Felicity and Cecily each got a pink and gold vase Even Sara Ray was made happy by the gift of a little china plate with a loudly coloured picture of Moses and Aaron before Pharaoh in the middle of it Moses wore a scarlet cloak while Aaron disported himself in bright blue Pharaoh was arrayed in yellow The plate had a scalloped border with a wreath of green leaves around it I shall never use it to eat off said Sara rapturously Ill put it up on the parlour mantelpiece I dont see much use in having a plate just for ornament said Felicity Its nice to have something interesting to look at retorted Sara who felt that the soul must have food as well as the body Im going to get a candle for my candlestick and use it every night to go to bed with said the Story Girl And Ill never light it without thinking of poor Rachel Ward But I DO wish she had been pretty Well said Felicity with a glance at the clock its all over and it has been very interesting But that clock has got to be put back to the right time some time through the day I dont want bedtime coming a whole half-hour before it ought to In the afternoon when Aunt Janet was over at Uncle Rogers seeing him and Aunt Olivia off to town the clock was righted The Story Girl and Peter came over to stay all night with us and we made taffy in the kitchen which the grown-ups kindly gave over to us for that purpose Of course it was very interesting to see the old chest unpacked said the Story Girl as she stirred the contents of a saucepan vigorously But now that it is over I believe I am sorry that it is opened It isnt mysterious any longer We know all about it now and we can never imagine what things are in it any more Its better to know than to imagine said Felicity Oh no it isnt said the Story Girl quickly When you know things you have to go by facts But when you just dream about things theres nothing to hold you down Youre letting the taffy scorch and THATS a fact youd better go by said Felicity sniffing Havent you got a nose? When we went to bed that wonderful white enchantress the moon was making an elf-land of the snow-misted world outside From where I lay I could see the sharp tops of the spruces against the silvery sky The frost was abroad and the winds were still and the land lay in glamour Across the hall the Story Girl was telling Felicity and Cecily the old old tale of Argive Helen and evil-hearted Paris But thats a bad story said Felicity when the tale was ended She left her husband and run away with another man I suppose it was bad four thousand years ago admitted the Story Girl But by this time the bad must have all gone out of it Its only the good that could last so long Our summer was over It had been a beautiful one We had known the sweetness of common joys the delight of dawns the dream and glamour of noontides the long purple peace of carefree nights We had had the pleasure of bird song of silver rain on greening fields of storm among the trees of blossoming meadows and of the converse of whispering leaves We had had brotherhood with wind and star with books and tales and hearth fires of autumn Ours had been the little loving tasks of every day blithe companionship shared thoughts and adventuring Rich were we in the memory of those opulent months that had gone from us--richer than we then knew or suspected And before us was the dream of spring It is always safe to dream of spring For it is sure to come; and if it be not just as we have pictured it it will be infinitely sweeter THE END End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Story Girl by Lucy Maud Montgomery *** END
