PURPOSE The purpose of the following account is to (1) Show what kinds of chipmunks occur in Wyoming; (2) point out the interrelationships between these kinds; and (3) account where possible for the present distribution of these animals in Wyoming METHODS MATERIALS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Capitalized color terms in the following accounts are of Ridgway Color Standards and Color Nomenclature Washington DC 1912 The measurements of the skull that were used in this study were made as shown in White (1953566 fig 1) These are Greatest length of skull zygomatic breadth cranial breadth length of nasals length of lower tooth-row condylo-alveolar length of mandible and inner mandibular length Of the external measurements only the total length and the length of the tail are recorded in table 1 Some field collectors measured the ear from the notch and others from the crown; most collectors measured the length of the hindfoot to the nearest millimeter rather than in tenths of a millimeter as would have been desirable Consequently I decided against using the length of the ear and hindfoot in this report When the word significantly is used in comparisons it is meant to show that there is a significant statistical difference between two or more samples Whenever eight or more specimens from one locality were available the mean range standard deviation standard error of the mean and coefficient of variability were calculated Only adult specimens were used in comparison Aging of specimens is discussed on page 587 of this paper The geographic range of each species and subspecies is not described in writing for the localities are plotted on maps along with the geographic range of each subspecies and under specimens examined the locality of each specimen or series of specimens is listed In the synonymy of each subspecies there appears first the first usage of a name second the first usage of the name combination now employed and third pure synonyms A total of 757 specimens of chipmunks are listed as examined in the course of preparing this report Additional specimens were less carefully examined in the Biological Surveys Collection in Washington DC Specimens used in my study unless otherwise specified are in the Museum of Natural History University of Kansas The symbols representing the collections containing specimens studied are as follows BS--United States

Research through contract No NR161 791 VARIATION Secondary sexual variation in chipmunks is small; the females are slightly larger than the males This difference in size is so slight that it can be ignored when making taxonomic comparisons for large samples of males and females of like age and from the same locality were compared and were found statistically not to be significantly different This is in agreement with Johnson (194370) and Hall (1946329) Variations of taxonomic worth are treated in the accounts of species and subspecies Individual variation is slight for the analyses of measurements of the skulls of series of specimens of like age reveal markedly low coefficients of variability resembling those published by Larrison (1949) The age-categories here recognized are based primarily on the structure of the skull _Juveniles_--Nasals proportionally shorter and more pointed anteriorly than in other categories; zygomatic arches more appressed to cranium; suture separating basisphenoid and presphenoid noticeably open; deciduous P4 and p4 show no wear through enamel; M3 and m3 not yet erupted; peglike deciduous P3 strongly leaning posteriorly; molars show no wear through enamel; parietals paperlike or thin; skull convex dorsally; 1 to 1-1/2 months of age _Young_--Nasals of adult proportions; zygomatic arches still noticeably appressed anteriorly to cranium; suture between basisphenoid and presphenoid still open; nasals rounded no longer so pointed as in juveniles; deciduous P4 and p4 show wear through enamel layer and in some specimens permanent P4 and p4 can be seen beneath; roots of deciduous P4 and p4 clearly show erosion beneath; M3 and m3 fully erupted; peglike deciduous P3 still present; parietals noticeably thicker and less paperlike; skull flattened (not so convex dorsally) but not so flattened as in adults; 1-1/2 to 4 months of age In both juveniles and young the P4 and p4 are deciduous and differ in occlusal pattern from the permanent P4 and p4 In the deciduous P4 the anterior cingulum is projected strongly anteriorly forming the apex of the sharpest angle of a triangle whereas the permanent P4 is trapezoidal in occlusal pattern In the deciduous p4 the protoconid and metaconid are close together giving this tooth a triangular appearance in occlusal pattern whereas this pattern in permanent p4 is trapezoidal (see Hall 1926390) _Subadults_--Adult configuration of skull reached; suture between basisphenoid and presphenoid completely closed; nasals rounded anteriorly; permanent P4 and p4 show no wear through enamel layer; wear through enamel layer of molars noticeable especially through protocones; peglike permanent P3 slanting only slightly posteriorly; skull only slightly convex dorsally; parietals solid and resistant to pressure; lambdoidal crest weakly developed; 4 to 10 months of age _Adults_--Lambdoidal crest well developed; supraorbital ridges pronounced; P4 and p4 show wear through enamel layer and frequently as worn as molars; noticeable wear on lophs and lophids of molars; occlusal pattern always visible; ten months to 2 years of age _Old adults_--Ridges and crests extremely well developed; occlusal pattern of molariform teeth obliterated or nearly so; P3 noticeably worn; 2 to 4 years or older The hypohyal and ceratohyal bones of the hyoid apparatus are distinct from one another in juveniles and young but are fused in subadults adults and old adults Lack of suitable material prevented me from studying chipmunks younger than juveniles The patterns of growth of these younger chipmunks probably closely follow the changes described by Hall (1926) for _Citellus beecheyi_ The tip of the baculum in juveniles and young is proportionally longer in relation to the shaft than in subadults adults and old adults Juvenal (juveniles and young) pelage in chipmunks is characterized by silkiness and sparseness especially on the venter The coloration of this juvenal pelage resembles that of adults in winter pelage which is duller than adult summer pelage Adult pelage (subadults adults and old adults) is not so silky as juvenal pelage but there are more hairs especially on the venter The color pattern is the same in both juvenal and adult pelages Chipmunks are born naked and blind and in about two weeks the body is covered with silken hair clearly demonstrating the color pattern so characteristic of chipmunks (Shaw 1944282) This silken hair is replaced by adult summer pelage and juvenal chipmunks which are molting into adult summer pelage closely resemble the adult males and later on in the summer the adult females Adult females molt later as a rule than adult males probably because of lactation Summer molt begins on chipmunks in Wyoming and South Dakota in the latter part of June and is completed by the latter part of August or the first part of September Summer molt begins topographically in the region of the head and progresses posteriorly to the base of the tail for the tail does not molt into summer pelage The winter molt starts at the same time at the tip of the tail and at the base of the tail and from each place proceeds anteriorly The sequence described above is the rule; exceptionally there are some specimens which molted in patches In most skins molts are easily detected because distinct molt-lines were formed The above description of molting is based on study of a large series of specimens of _Eutamias minimus silvaticus_ taken in several seasons of the year The summer pelage is bright more especially on the sides In late summer the pelage on the tail is markedly worn and the hairs around its outer margin are broken In texture the summer pelage is not so soft as winter pelage and this is probably owing to the presence of large amounts of kinky underfur in the winter pelage The winter pelage is soft dull in color and gives the specimen a grayish or an umbrous appearance The guard hairs are longer than in the summer pelage KEY TO THE SPECIES OF THE CHIPMUNKS OF WYOMING 1 Dorsal stripes faint; general tone of upper parts grayish _Eutamias dorsalis_ p 603 1 Dorsal stripes distinct; general tone of upper parts tawny (not grayish) 2 Venter yellowish or buff; tip of baculum more than 30 per cent of length of shaft; shaft of baculum not widened at base _Eutamias amoenus_ p 602 2 Venter white; tip of baculum less than 29 per cent of length of shaft--if more than 29 per cent shaft widened at base 3 Size small to medium; greatest length of skull less than 34 mm; shaft of baculum not widened at base; outermost dorsal dark stripe never obsolete _Eutamias minimus_ p 590 3 Size large; greatest length of skull rarely less than 34 mm; shaft of baculum widened at base; outermost dorsal dark stripe often obsolete never strongly evident _Eutamias umbrinus_ p 606 ACCOUNTS OF SPECIES AND SUBSPECIES Eutamias minimus (Bachman) _Diagnosis_--Size small; tip of baculum of adults less than 28 per cent of length of shaft; outermost dorsal dark stripes distinct; skull small to medium; when skull medium zygomatic breadth not proportionally narrower _Comparisons_--From _Eutamias amoenus luteiventris_ the only subspecies of that species in Wyoming _E minimus_ differs in Size smaller; tip of baculum in adults less than 28 per cent of length of shaft; zygomatic arches proportionally wider; underparts white or with less yellow or tawny From _E umbrinus_ _E minimus_ differs in Size smaller; general tone of upper parts lighter; base of baculum not widened but almost as narrow as least diameter of shaft Illustration FIG 1 Known occurrence and probable geographic distribution of the subspecies of _Eutamias minimus_ in Wyoming The symbols for locality records are as follows Circles specimens reported but not examined; solid circles precise localities of specimens examined; solid triangles localities of specimens examined known only to county 1 _E m minimus_ 2 _E m consobrinus_ 3 _E m pallidus_ 4 _E m confinis_ 5 _E m silvaticus_ 6 _E m operarius_ From _E dorsalis utahensis_ the only subspecies of this species in Wyoming _E minimus_ differs in Dorsal dark stripes distinct and usually blackish; skull smaller; tip of baculum of adults less than 28 per cent of length of shaft _Remarks_--This is the smallest of the species of chipmunks in Wyoming and in the state can be readily distinguished from the other species by the smaller size and by the characteristic proportions of the baculum _E minimus_ occurs in all the Life-zones of Wyoming and inhabits open country such as in the great expanses where sagebrush (_Artemesia_ sp) is predominant or inhabits the edges of forests never occurring in the forest proper Analyses of measurements of the skull indicate that of the six subspecies of _E minimus_ that are found in Wyoming two are small (_E m minimus_ and _E m consobrinus_) and the other four are large (_E m pallidus_ _E m confinis_ _E m silvaticus_ and _E m operarius_) Within these size-groups the subspecies can be distinguished by differences in color pattern Eutamias minimus minimus (Bachman) _Tamias minimus_ Bachman Jour Acad Nat Sci Philadelphia 8(pt 1)71 1839

Intergradation between _E m pallidus_ and _E m minimus_ probably exists in northeastern Natrona Co and southwestern Johnson Co Comparisons of specimens of _E m pallidus_ and _E m cacodemus_ indicates

Landing 1 REVIEW AND CONCLUSIONS _Eutamias minimus_ in Wyoming is divisible into two size-groups of subspecies; the smaller size-group (_E m minimus_ and _E m consobrinus_) which occurs in the western part of the State is significantly smaller in measurements of the skull and baculum than the larger size-group (_E m pallidas_ _E m confinis_ _E m silvaticus_ and _E m operarius_) which occurs in the eastern part of the State Although all the six subspecies of _E minimus_ in Wyoming can be differentiated from one another by color pattern this species cannot be divided by means of color pattern into two groups comparable in geographic range to the two size-groups that were established above on the basis of variations in the skull and baculum Thus the subspecies of _E minimus_ are morphologically differentiated at two distinct levels; one level is based on differences in the skull and baculum while the other is based on differences in color Although there is considerable controversy concerning the glacial chronology in the mountains of western North America (Flint 1947302-303) it is generally agreed that in Wyoming in Wisconsinan time (the latest glacial age) glaciers covered a large part of the Yellowstone-Teton-Wind River highlands the Big Horn Mountains the southern part of the Laramie Range the Medicine Bow Range Sierra Madre Range and the northern foothills of the Uinta Mountains With this in mind a possible explanation of the geographic variation in _E minimus_ of Wyoming is here attempted In Sangamonian time _E minimus_-like chipmunks occurred over most of the region which is now Wyoming and were divided into two size-groups much as _E minimus_ is today When permanent snow fields were formed in Wisconsinan time these chipmunks were restricted in their ranges not of course occurring on the glaciers When the glaciers melted at the end of Wisconsinan time new habitats were thus uncovered The chipmunks which moved into these ice-free areas then became adapted to the new habitats This then accounts for the subspeciation of _E m consobrinus_ _E m confinis_ and _E m operarius_ The Black Hills were not covered by glaciers In late Pleistocene time these hills were probably of low relief Subsequent differential erosion produced relief sufficient to provide a different habitat The chipmunks that continued to occupy this area adapted themselves in color to the new habitat and became _E m silvaticus_ LITERATURE CITED CARY M 1917 Life zone investigations in Wyoming N Amer Fauna 421-96 15 pls 17 figs FLINT R F 1947 Glacial geology

Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment Many small donations ($1 to $5000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit https//pglaforg While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States US laws alone swamp our small staff Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including including checks online payments and credit card donations To donate please visit https//pglaforg/donate Section 5 General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works Professor Michael S Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility https//wwwgutenbergorg This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks
