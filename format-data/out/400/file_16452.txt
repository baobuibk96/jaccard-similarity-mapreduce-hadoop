Clerks Office of the District Court for the Southern District of New York TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE EARL COWPER THIS TRANSLATION OF THE ILIAD THE INSCRIPTION OF WHICH TO HIMSELF THE LATE LAMENTED EARL BENEVOLENT TO ALL AND ESPECIALLY KIND TO THE AUTHOR HAD NOT DISDAINED TO ACCEPT IS HUMBLY OFFERED AS A SMALL BUT GRATEFUL TRIBUTE TO THE MEMORY OF HIS FATHER BY HIS LORDSHIPS AFFECTIONATE KINSMAN AND SERVANT WILLIAM COWPER _June 4 1791_ PREFACE Whether a translation of Homer may be best executed in blank verse or in rhyme is a question in the decision of which no man can find difficulty who has ever duly considered what translation ought to be or who is in any degree practically acquainted with those very different kinds of versification I will venture to assert that a just translation of any ancient poet in rhyme is impossible No human ingenuity can be equal to the task of closing every couplet with sounds homotonous expressing at the same time the full sense and only the full sense of his original The translators ingenuity indeed in this case becomes itself a snare and the readier he is at invention and expedient the more likely he is to be betrayed into the widest departures from the guide whom he professes to follow Hence it has happened that although the public have long been in possession of an English Homer by a poet whose writings have done immortal honor to his country the demand of a new one and especially in blank verse has been repeatedly and loudly made by some of the best judges and ablest writers of the present day I have no contest with my predecessor None is supposable between performers on different instruments Mr Pope has surmounted all difficulties in his version of Homer that it was possible to surmount in rhyme But he was fettered and his fetters were his choice Accustomed always to rhyme he had formed to himself an ear which probably could not be much gratified by verse that wanted it and determined to encounter even impossibilities rather than abandon a mode of writing in which he had excelled every body for the sake of another to which unexercised in it as he was he must have felt strong objections I number myself among the warmest admirers of Mr Pope as an original writer and I allow him all the merit he can justly claim as the translator of this chief of poets He has given us the _Tale of Troy divine_ in smooth verse generally in correct and elegant language and in diction often highly poetical But his deviations are so many occasioned chiefly by the cause already mentioned that much as he has done and valuable as his work is on some accounts it was yet in the humble province of a translator that I thought it possible even for me to fellow him with some advantage That he has sometimes altogether suppressed the sense of his author and has not seldom intermingled his own ideas with it is a remark which on this occasion nothing but necessity should have extorted from me But we differ sometimes so widely in our matter that unless this remark invidious as it seems be premised I know not how to obviate a suspicion on the one hand of careless oversight or of factitious embellishment on the other On this head therefore the English reader is to be admonished that the matter found in me whether he like it or not is found also in Homer and that the matter not found in me how much soever he may admire it is found only in Mr Pope I have omitted nothing; I have invented nothing There is indisputably a wide difference between the case of an original writer in rhyme and a translator In an original work the author is free; if the rhyme be of difficult attainment and he cannot find it in one direction he is at liberty to seek it in another; the matter that will not accommodate itself to his occasions he may discard adopting such as will But in a translation no such option is allowable; the sense of the author is required and we do not surrender it willingly even to the plea of necessity Fidelity is indeed of the very essence of translation and the term itself implies it For which reason if we suppress the sense of our original and force into its place our own we may call our work an _imitation_ if we please or perhaps a _paraphrase_ but it is no longer the same author only in a different dress and therefore it is not translation Should a painter professing to draw the likeness of a beautiful woman give her more or fewer features than belong to her and a general cast of countenance of his own invention he might be said to have produced a _jeu desprit_ a curiosity perhaps in its way but by no means the lady in question It will however be necessary to speak a little more largely to this subject on which discordant opinions prevail even among good judges The free and the close translation have each their advocates But inconveniences belong to both The former can hardly be true to the original authors style and manner and the latter is apt to be servile The one loses his peculiarities and the other his spirit Were it possible therefore to find an exact medium a manner so close that it should let slip nothing of the text nor mingle any thing extraneous with it and at the same time so free as to have an air of originality this seems precisely the mode in which an author might be best rendered I can assure my readers from my own experience that to discover this very delicate line is difficult and to proceed by it when found through the whole length of a poet voluminous as Homer nearly impossible I can only pretend to have endeavored it It is an opinion commonly received but like many others indebted for its prevalence to mere want of examination that a translator should imagine to himself the style which his author would probably have used had the language into which he is rendered been his own A direction which wants nothing but practicability to recommend it For suppose six persons equally qualified for the task employed to translate the same Ancient into their own language with this rule to guide them In the event it would be found that each had fallen on a manner different from that of all the rest and by probable inference it would follow that none had fallen on the right On the whole therefore as has been said the translation which partakes equally of fidelity and liberality that is close but not so close as to be servile free but not so free as to be licentious promises fairest; and my ambition will be sufficiently gratified if such of my readers as are able and will take the pains to compare me in this respect with Homer shall judge that I have in any measure attained a point so difficult As to energy and harmony two grand requisites in a translation of this most energetic and most harmonious of all poets it is neither my purpose nor my wish should I be found deficient in either or in both to shelter myself under an unfilial imputation of blame to my mother-tongue Our language is indeed less musical than the Greek and there is no language with which I am at all acquainted that is not But it is musical enough for the purposes of melodious verse and if it seem to fail on whatsoever occasion in energy the blame is due not to itself but to the unskilful manager of it For so long as Miltons works whether his prose or his verse shall exist so long there will be abundant proof that no subject however important however sublime can demand greater force of expression than is within the compass of the English language I have no fear of judges familiar with original Homer They need not be told that a translation of him is an arduous enterprise and as such entitled to some favor From these therefore I shall expect and shall not be disappointed considerable candor and allowance Especially _they_ will be candid and I believe that there are many such who have occasionally tried their own strength in this _bow of Ulysses_ They have not found it supple and pliable and with me are perhaps ready to acknowledge that they could not always even approach with it the mark of their ambition But I would willingly were it possible obviate uncandid criticism because to answer it is lost labor and to receive it in silence has the appearance of stately reserve and self-importance To those therefore who shall be inclined to tell me hereafter that my diction is often plain and unelevated I reply beforehand that I know it that it would be absurd were it otherwise and that Homer himself stands in the same predicament In fact it is one of his numberless excellences and a point in which his judgment never fails him that he is grand and lofty always in the right place and knows infallibly how to rise and fall with his subject _Big words on small matters_ may serve as a pretty exact definition of the burlesque; an instance of which they will find in the Battle of the Frogs and Mice but none in the Iliad By others I expect to be told that my numbers though here and there tolerably smooth are not always such but have now and then an ugly hitch in their gait ungraceful in itself and inconvenient to the reader To this charge also I plead guilty but beg leave in alleviation of judgment to add that my limping lines are not numerous compared with those that limp not The truth is that not one of them all escaped me but such as they are they were all made such with a wilful intention In poems of great length there is no blemish more to be feared than sameness of numbers and every art is useful by which it may be avoided A line rough in itself has yet its recommendations; it saves the ear the pain of an irksome monotony and seems even to add greater smoothness to others Milton whose ear and taste were exquisite has exemplified in his Paradise Lost the effect of this practice frequently Having mentioned Milton I cannot but add an observation on the similitude of his manner to that of Homer It is such that no person familiar with both can read either without being reminded of the other; and it is in those breaks and pauses to which the numbers of the English poet are so much indebted both for their dignity and variety that he chiefly copies the Grecian But these are graces to which rhyme is not competent; so broken it loses all its music; of which any person may convince himself by reading a page only of any of our poets anterior to Denham Waller and Dryden A translator of Homer therefore seems directed by Homer himself to the use of blank verse as to that alone in which he can be rendered with any tolerable representation of his manner in this particular A remark which I am naturally led to make by a desire to conciliate if possible some who rather unreasonably partial to rhyme demand it on all occasions and seem persuaded that poetry in our language is a vain attempt without it Verse that claims to be verse in right of its metre only they judge to be such rather by courtesy than by kind on an apprehension that it costs the writer little trouble that he has only to give his lines their prescribed number of syllables and so far as the mechanical part is concerned all is well Were this true they would have reason on their side; for the author is certainly best entitled to applause who succeeds against the greatest difficulty and in verse that calls for the most artificial management in its construction But the case is not as they suppose To rhyme in our language demands no great exertion of ingenuity but is always easy to a person exercised in the practice Witness the multitudes who rhyme but have no other poetical pretensions Let it be considered too how merciful we are apt to be to unclassical and indifferent language for the sake of rhyme and we shall soon see that the labor lies principally on the other side Many ornaments of no easy purchase are required to atone for the absence of this single recommendation It is not sufficient that the lines of blank verse be smooth in themselves they must also be harmonious in the combination Whereas the chief concern of the rhymist is to beware that his couplets and his sense be commensurate lest the regularity of his numbers should be (too frequently at least) interrupted A trivial difficulty this compared with those which attend the poet unaccompanied by his bells He in order that he may be musical must exhibit all the variations as he proceeds of which ten syllables are susceptible; between the first syllable and the last there is no place at which he must not occasionally pause and the place of the pause must be perpetually shifted To effect this variety his attention must be given at one and the same time to the pauses he has already made in the period before him as well as to that which he is about to make and to those which shall succeed it On no lighter terms than these is it possible that blank verse can be written which will not in the course of a long work fatigue the ear past all endurance If it be easier therefore to throw five balls into the air and to catch them in succession than to sport in that manner with one only then may blank verse be more easily fabricated than rhyme And if to these labors we add others equally requisite a style in general more elaborate than rhyme requires farther removed from the vernacular idiom both in the language itself and in the arrangement of it we shall not long doubt which of these two very different species of verse threatens the composer with most expense of study and contrivance I feel it unpleasant to appeal to my own experience but having no other voucher at hand am constrained to it As I affirm so I have found I have dealt pretty largely in both kinds and have frequently written more verses in a day with tags than I could ever write without them To what has been here said (which whether it have been said by others or not I cannot tell having never read any modern book on the subject) I shall only add that to be poetical without rhyme is an argument of a sound and classical constitution in any language A word or two on the subject of the following translation and I have done My chief boast is that I have adhered closely to my original convinced that every departure from him would be punished with the forfeiture of some grace or beauty for which I could substitute no equivalent The epithets that would consent to an English form I have preserved as epithets; others that would not I have melted into the context There are none I believe which I have not translated in one way or other though the reader will not find them repeated so often as most of them are in Homer for a reason that need not be mentioned Few persons of any consideration are introduced either in the Iliad or Odyssey by their own name only but their patronymic is given also To this ceremonial I have generally attended because it is a circumstance of my authors manner Homer never allots less than a whole line to the introduction of a speaker No not even when the speech itself is no longer than the line that leads it A practice to which since he never departs from it he must have been determined by some cogent reason He probably deemed it a formality necessary to the majesty of his narration In this article therefore I have scrupulously adhered to my pattern considering these introductory lines as heralds in a procession; important persons because employed to usher in persons more important than themselves It has been my point every where to be as little verbose as possible though; at the same time my constant determination not to sacrifice my authors full meaning to an affected brevity In the affair of style I have endeavored neither to creep nor to bluster for no author is so likely to betray his translator into both these faults as Homer though himself never guilty of either I have cautiously avoided all terms of new invention with an abundance of which persons of more ingenuity than judgment have not enriched our language but incumbered it I have also every where used an unabbreviated fullness of phrase as most suited to the nature of the work and above all have studied perspicuity not only because verse is good for little that wants it but because Homer is the most perspicuous of all poets In all difficult places I have consulted the best commentators and where they have differed or have given as is often the case a variety of solutions I have ever exercised my best judgment and selected that which appears at least to myself the most probable interpretation On this ground and on account of the fidelity which I have already boasted I may venture I believe to recommend my work as promising some usefulness to young students of the original The passages which will be least noticed and possibly not at all except by those who shall wish to find me at a fault are those which have cost me abundantly the most labor It is difficult to kill a sheep with dignity in a modern language to flay and to prepare it for the table detailing every circumstance of the process Difficult also without sinking below the level of poetry to harness mules to a wagon particularizing every article of their furniture straps rings staples and even the tying of the knots that kept all together Homer who writes always to the eye with all his sublimity and grandeur has the minuteness of a Flemish painter But in what degree I have succeeded in my version either of these passages and such as these or of others more buoyant and above-ground and especially of the most sublime is now submitted to the decision of the reader to whom I am ready enough to confess that I have not at all consulted their approbation who account nothing grand that is not turgid or elegant that is not bedizened with metaphor I purposely decline all declamation on the merits of Homer because a translators praises of his author are liable to a suspicion of dotage and because it were impossible to improve on those which this author has received already He has been the wonder of all countries that his works have ever reached even deified by the greatest names of antiquity and in some places actually worshipped And to say truth were it possible that mere man could entitle himself by pre-eminence of any kind to divine honors Homers astonishing powers seem to have given him the best pretensions I cannot conclude without due acknowledgments to the best critic in Homer I have ever met with the learned and ingenious Mr Fuseli Unknown as he was to me when I entered on this arduous undertaking (indeed to this moment I have never seen him) he yet voluntarily and generously offered himself as my revisor To his classical taste and just discernment I have been indebted for the discovery of many blemishes in my own work and of beauties which would otherwise have escaped me in the original But his necessary avocations would not suffer him to accompany me farther than to the latter books of the Iliad a circumstance which I fear my readers as well as myself will regret with too much reason1 I have obligations likewise to many friends whose names were it proper to mention them here would do me great honor They have encouraged me by their approbation have assisted me with valuable books and have eased me of almost the whole labor of transcribing And now I have only to regret that my pleasant work is ended To the illustrious Greek I owe the smooth and easy flight of many thousand hours He has been my companion at home and abroad in the study in the garden and in the field; and no measure of success let my labors succeed as they may will ever compensate to me the loss of the innocent luxury that I have enjoyed as a translator of Homer Footnote Some of the few notes subjoined to my translation of the Odyssey are by Mr Fuseli who had a short opportunity to peruse the MSS while the Iliad was printing They are marked with his initial PREFACE PREPARED BY MR COWPER FOR A SECOND EDITION Soon after my publication of this work I began to prepare it for a second edition by an accurate revisal of the first It seemed to me that here and there perhaps a slight alteration might satisfy the demands of some whom I was desirous to please; and I comforted myself with the reflection that if I still failed to conciliate all I should yet have no cause to account myself in a singular degree unfortunate To please an unqualified judge an author must sacrifice too much; and the attempt to please an uncandid one were altogether hopeless In one or other of these classes may be ranged all such objectors as would deprive blank verse of one of its principal advantages the variety of its pauses; together with all such as deny the good effect on the whole of a line now and then less harmonious than its fellows With respect to the pauses it has been affirmed with an unaccountable rashness that Homer himself has given me an example of verse without them Had this been true it would by no means have concluded against the use of them in an English version of Homer; because in one language and in one species of metre that may be musical which in another would be found disgusting But the assertion is totally unfounded The pauses in Homers verse are so frequent and various that to name another poet if pauses are a fault more faulty than he were perhaps impossible It may even be questioned if a single passage of ten lines flowing with uninterrupted smoothness could be singled out from all the thousands that he has left us He frequently pauses at the first word of the line when it consists of three or more syllables; not seldom when of two; and sometimes even when of one only In this practice he was followed as was observed in my Preface to the first edition by the Author of the Paradise Lost An example inimitable indeed but which no writer of English heroic verse without rhyme can neglect with impunity Similar to this is the objection which proscribes absolutely the occasional use of a line irregularly constructed When Horace censured Lucilius for his lines _incomposite pede currentes_ he did not mean to say that he was chargeable with such in some instances or even in many for then the censure would have been equally applicable to himself; but he designed by that expression to characterize all his writings The censure therefore was just; Lucilius wrote at a time when the Roman verse had not yet received its polish and instead of introducing artfully his rugged lines and to serve a particular purpose had probably seldom and never but by accident composed a smooth one Such has been the versification of the earliest poets in every country Children lisp at first and stammer; but in time their speech becomes fluent and if they are well taught harmonious Homer himself is not invariably regular in the construction of his verse Had he been so Eustathius an excellent critic and warm admirer of Homer had never affirmed that some of his lines want a head some a tail and others a middle Some begin with a word that is neither dactyl nor spondee some conclude with a dactyl and in the intermediate part he sometimes deviates equally from the established custom I confess that instances of this sort are rare; but they are surely though few sufficient to warrant a sparing use of similar license in the present day Unwilling however to seem obstinate in both these particulars I conformed myself in some measure to these objections though unconvinced myself of their propriety Several of the rudest and most unshapely lines I composed anew; and several of the pauses least in use I displaced for the sake of an easier enunciation And this was the state of the work after the revisal given it about seven years since Between that revisal and the present a considerable time intervened and the effect of long discontinuance was that I became more dissatisfied with it myself than the most difficult to be pleased of all my judges Not for the sake of a few uneven lines or unwonted pauses but for reasons far more substantial The diction seemed to me in many passages either not sufficiently elevated or deficient in the grace of ease and in others I found the sense of the original either not adequately expressed or misapprehended Many elisions still remained unsoftened; the compound epithets I found not always happily combined and the same sometimes too frequently repeated There is no end of passages in Homer which must creep unless they are lifted; yet in such all embellishment is out of the question The hero puts on his clothes or refreshes himself with food and wine or he yokes his steed takes a journey and in the evening preparation is made for his repose To give relief to subjects prosaic as these without seeming unreasonably tumid is extremely difficult Mr Pope much abridges some of them and others he omits; but neither of these liberties was compatible with the nature of my undertaking These therefore and many similar to these have been new-modeled; somewhat to their advantage I hope but not even now entirely to my satisfaction The lines have a more natural movement the pauses are fewer and less stately the expression as easy as I could make it without meanness and these were all the improvements that I could give them The elisions I believe are all cured with only one exception An alternative proposes itself to a modern versifier from which there is no escape which occurs perpetually and which choose as he may presents him always with an evil I mean in the instance of the particle (_the_) When this particle precedes a vowel shall he melt it into the substantive or leave the _hiatus_ open? Both practices are offensive to a delicate ear The particle absorbed occasions harshness and the open vowel a vacuity equally inconvenient Sometimes therefore to leave it open and sometimes to ingraft it into its adjunct seems most advisable; this course Mr Pope has taken whose authority recommended it to me; though of the two evils I have most frequently chosen the elision as the least Compound epithets have obtained so long in the poetical language of our country that I employed them without fear or scruple To have abstained from them in a blank verse translation of Homer who abounds with them and from whom our poets probably first adopted them would have been strange indeed But though the genius of our language favors the formation of such words almost as much as that of the Greek it happens sometimes that a Grecian compound either cannot be rendered in English at all or at best but awkwardly For this reason and because I found that some readers much disliked them I have expunged many; retaining according to my best judgment the most eligible only and making less frequent the repetitions even of these I know not that I can add any thing material on the subject of this last revisal unless it be proper to give the reason why the Iliad though greatly altered has undergone much fewer alterations than the Odyssey The true reason I believe is this The Iliad demanded my utmost possible exertions; it seemed to meet me like an ascent almost perpendicular which could not be surmounted at less cost than of all the labor that I could bestow on it The Odyssey on the contrary seemed to resemble an open and level country through which I might travel at my ease The latter therefore betrayed me into some negligence which though little conscious of it at the time on an accurate search I found had left many disagreeable effects behind it I now leave the work to its fate Another may labor hereafter in an attempt of the same kind with more success; but more industriously I believe none ever will PREFACE BY J JOHNSON LLB CHAPLAIN TO THE BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH I have no other pretensions to the honorable name of Editor on this occasion than as a faithful transcriber of the Manuscript and a diligent corrector of the Press which are doubtless two of the very humblest employments in that most extensive province I have wanted the ability to attempt any thing higher; and fortunately for the reader I have also wanted the presumption What however I can do I will Instead of critical remark I will furnish him with anecdote He shall trace from beginning to end the progress of the following work; and in proportion as I have the happiness to engage his attention I shall merit the name of a fortunate editor It was in the darkest season of a most calamitous depression of his spirits that I was summoned to the house of my inestimable friend the Translator in the month of January 1794 He had happily completed a revisal of his Homer and was thinking of the preface to his new edition when all his satisfaction in the one and whatever he had projected for the other in a moment vanished from his mind He had fallen into a deplorable illness; and though the foremost wish of my heart was to lessen the intenseness of his misery I was utterly unable to afford him any aid I had however a pleasing though a melancholy opportunity of tracing his recent footsteps in the Field of Troy and in the Palace of Ithaca He had materially altered both the Iliad and Odyssey; and so far as my ability allowed me to judge they were each of them greatly improved He had also at the request of his bookseller interspersed the two poems with copious notes; for the most part translations of the ancient Scholia and gleaned at the cost of many valuable hours from the pages of Barnes Clarke and Villoisson It has been a constant subject of regret to the admirers of The Task that the exercise of such marvelous original powers should have been so long suspended by the drudgery of translation; and in this view their quarrel with the illustrious Greek will be doubtless extended to his commentators1 During two long years from this most anxious period the translation continued as it was; and though in the hope of its being able to divert his melancholy I had attempted more than once to introduce it to its Author I was every time painfully obliged to desist But in the summer of ninety-six when he had resided with me in Norfolk twelve miserable months the introduction long wished for took place To my inexpressible astonishment and joy I surprised him one morning with the Iliad in his hand; and with an excess of delight which I am still more unable to describe I the next day discovered that he had been writing Were I to mention one of the happiest moments of my life it might be that which introduced me to the following lines Mistaken meanings corrected admonente G Wakefield B XXIII L 429that the nave Of thy neat wheel seem een to grind upon it L 865As when (the north wind freshening) near the bank Up springs a fish in air then falls again And disappears beneath the sable flood So at the stroke he bounded L 1018Thenceforth Tydides oer his ample shield Aimd and still aimd to pierce him in the neck Or better thus Tydides in return with spear high-poised Oer the broad shield aimd ever at his neck Or best of all Then Tydeus son with spear high-poised above The ample shield stood aiming at his neck He had written these lines with a pencil on a leaf at the end of his Iliad; and when I reflected on the cause which had given them birth I could not but admire its disproportion to the effect What the voice of persuasion had failed in for a year accident had silently accomplished in a single day The circumstance I allude to was this I received a copy of the Iliad and Odyssey of Pope then recently published by the Editor above mentioned with illustrative and critical notes of his own As it commended Mr Cowpers Translation in the Preface and occasionally pointed out its merits in the Notes I was careful to place it in his way; though it was more from a habit of experiment which I had contracted than from well-grounded hopes of success But what a fortunate circumstance was the arrival of this Work! and by what name worthy of its influence shall I call it? In the mouth of an indifferent person it might be Chance; but in mine; whom it rendered so peculiarly happy common gratitude requires that it should be Providence As I watched him with an indescribable interest in his progress I had the satisfaction to find that after a few mornings given to promiscuous correction and to frequent perusal of the above-mentioned Notes he was evidently settling on the sixteenth Book This he went regularly through and the fruits of an application so happily resumed were one day with another about sixty new lines But with the end of the sixteenth Book he had closed the corrections of the year An excursion to the coast which immediately followed though it promised an accession of strength to the body could not fail to interfere with the pursuits of the mind It was therefore with much less surprise than regret that I saw him relinquish the _Tale of Troy Divine_ Such was the prelude to the last revisal which in the month of January ninety-seven Mr Cowper was persuaded to undertake; and to a faithful copy as I trust of which I have at this time the honor to conduct the reader But it may not be amiss to observe that with regard to the earlier books of the Iliad it was less a revisal of the altered text than of the text as it stands in the first edition For though the interleaved copy was always at hand and in the multitude of its altered places could hardly fail to offer some things worthy to be preserved but which the ravages of illness and the lapse of time might have utterly effaced from his mind I could not often persuade the Translator to consult it I was therefore induced in the course of transcribing to compare the two revisals as I went along and to plead for the continuance of the first correction when it forcibly struck me as better than the last This however but seldom occurred; and the practice at length was completely left off by his consenting to receive into the number of the books which were daily laid open before him the interleaved copy to which I allude At the end of the first six books of the Iliad the arrival of spring brought the usual interruptions of exercise and air which increased as the summer advanced to a degree so unfavorable to the progress of Homer that in the requisite attention to their salutary claims the revisal was at one time altogether at a stand Only four books were added in the course of nine months; but opportunity returning as the winter set in there were added in less than seven weeks four more and thus ended the year ninety-seven As the spring that succeeded was a happier spring so it led to a happier summer We had no longer air and exercise alone but exercise and Homer hand in hand He even followed us thrice to the sea and whether our walks were on the margin of the land Oer the green summit of the cliffs whose base Beats back the roaring surge or on the shore Of the untillable and barren deep they were always within hearing of his magic song About the middle of this busy summer the revisal of the Iliad was brought to a close; and on the very next day the 24th of July the correction of the Odyssey commenced a morning rendered memorable by a kind and unexpected visit from the patroness of that work the Dowager Lady Spencer! It is not my intention to detain the reader with a progressive account of the Odyssey revised as circumstantial as that of the Iliad because it went on smoothly from beginning to end and was finished in less than eight months I cannot deliver these volumes to the public without feeling emotions of gratitude toward Heaven in recollecting how often this corrected Work has appeared to me an instrument of Divine mercy to mitigate the sufferings of my excellent relation Its progress in our private hours was singularly medicinal to his mind may its presentment to the Public prove not less conducive to the honor of the departed Author who has every claim to my veneration! As a copious life of the Poet is already in the press from the pen of his intimate friend Mr Hayley it is unnecessary for me to enter on such extensive commendation of his character as my own intimacy with him might suggest; but I hope the reader will kindly allow me the privilege of indulging in some degree the feelings of my heart by applying to him in the close of this Preface an expressive verse (borrowed from Homer) which he inscribed himself with some little variation on a bust of his Grecian Favorite xcexa9xcfx82 xcfx84xcexb5 xcfx80xcexb1xcfx84xcexb7xcfx81 xcfx89 xcfx80xcexb1xcexb9xcexb4xcexb9 xcexbaxcexb1xcexb9 xcexbfxcfx85xcfx80xcexbfxcfx84xcexb5 xcexbbxcexb7xcfx83xcexbfxcexbcxcexb1xcexb9 xcexb1xcfx85xcfx84xcexb5 Loved as his Son in him I early found A Father such as I will neer forget Footnote Very few signatures had at this time been affixed to the notes;

and that the version which he composed when his faculties were most active and his spirits least subject to depression indeed in the happiest part of his life ought not to be superseded by a revisal or rather reconstruction which was undertaken three years before his death not like the first translation as a pleasant work an innocent luxury the cheerful and delightful occupation of hope and ardor and ambition but as a hopeless employment a task to which he gave all his miserable days and often many hours of the night seeking to beguile the sense of utter wretchedness by altering as if for the sake of alteration The Editor has been confirmed in this opinion by the concurrence of every person with whom he has communicated on the subject Among others he takes the liberty of mentioning Mr Cary whose authority upon such a question is of especial weight the Translator of Dante being the only one of our countrymen who has ever executed a translation of equal magnitude and not less difficulty with the same perfect fidelity and admirable skill In support of this determination the case of Tasso may be cited as curiously in point The great Italian poet altered his Jerusalem like Cowper against his own judgment in submission to his critics he made the alteration in the latter years of his life and in a diseased state of mind; and he proceeded upon the same prescribed rule of smoothing down his versification and removing all the elisions The consequence has been that the reconstructed poem is utterly neglected and has rarely if ever been reprinted except in the two great editions of his collected works; while the original poem has been and continues to be in such demand that the most diligent bibliographer might vainly attempt to enumerate all the editions through which it has passed EDITORS NOTE It will be seen by the Advertisement to Southeys edition of Cowpers Translation of the Iliad that he has the highest opinion of its merits and that he also gives the preference to Cowpers unrevised edition The Editor of the present edition is happy to offer it to the public under the sanction of such high authority In the addition of notes I have availed myself of the learning of various commentators (Pope Coleridge Mxc3xbcller etc) and covet no higher praise than the approval of my judgment in the selection Those bearing the signature EPP were furnished by my friend Miss Peabody of Boston I would also acknowledge my obligations to CC Felton Eliot Professor of Greek in Harvard University It should be observed that the remarks upon the language of the poem refer to it in the original For a definite treatment of the character of each deity introduced in the Iliad and for the fable of the Judgment of Paris which was the primary cause of the Trojan war the reader is referred to Grecian and Roman Mythology It is intended that this edition of the Iliad shall be followed by a similar one of the Odyssey provided sufficient encouragement is given by the demand for the present volume CONTENTS BOOK I BOOK II BOOK III BOOK IV BOOK V BOOK VI BOOK VII BOOK VIII BOOK IX BOOK X BOOK XI BOOK XII BOOK XIII BOOK XIV BOOK XV BOOK XVI BOOK XVII BOOK XVIII BOOK XIX BOOK XX BOOK XXI BOOK XXII BOOK XXIII BOOK XXIV THE ILIAD OF HOMER TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH BLANK VERSE BOOK I ARGUMENT OF THE FIRST BOOK The book opens with an account of a pestilence that prevailed in the Grecian camp and the cause of it is assigned A council is called in which fierce altercation takes place between Agamemnon and Achilles The latter solemnly renounces the field Agamemnon by his heralds demands Brisxc3xabis and Achilles resigns her He makes his complaint to Thetis who undertakes to plead his cause with Jupiter She pleads it and prevails The book concludes with an account of what passed in Heaven on that occasion The reader will please observe that by Achaians Argives Danaxc3xaf are signified Grecians Homer himself having found these various appellatives both graceful and convenient it seemed unreasonable that a Translator of him should be denied the same advantage Tr BOOK I Achilles sing O Goddess!

Now it seems no course remains For us but that the seas roaming again We hence return; at least if we survive; But haste consult we quick some prophet here Or priest or even interpreter of dreams75 (For dreams are also of Jove) that we may learn By what crime we have thus incensed Apollo What broken vow what hecatomb unpaid He charges on us and if soothed with steam Of lambs or goats unblemishd he may yet80 Be won to spare us and avert the plague He spake and sat when Thestors son arose Calchas an augur foremost in his art Who all things present past and future knew And whom his skill in prophecy a gift85 Conferred by Phxc5x93bus on him had advanced To be conductor of the fleet to Troy; He prudent them admonishing replied12 Jove-loved Achilles! Wouldst thou learn from me What cause hath moved Apollo to this wrath90 The shaft-armd King? I shall divulge the cause But thou swear first and covenant on thy part That speaking acting thou wilt stand prepared To give me succor; for I judge amiss Or he who rules the Argives the supreme95 Oer all Achaias host will be incensed Wo to the man who shall provoke the King For if to-day he smother close his wrath He harbors still the vengeance and in time Performs it Answer therefore wilt thou save me?100 To whom Achilles swiftest of the swift What thou hast learnd in secret from the God That speak and boldly By the son of Jove Apollo whom thou Calchas seekst in prayer Made for the Danaxc3xaf and who thy soul105 Fills with futurity in all the host The Grecian lives not who while I shall breathe And see the light of day shall in this camp Oppress thee; no not even if thou name Him Agamemnon sovereign oer us all110 Then was the seer emboldend and he spake Nor vow nor hecatomb unpaid on us He charges but the wrong done to his priest Whom Agamemnon slighted when he sought His daughters freedom and his gifts refused115 He is the cause Apollo for his sake Afflicts and will afflict us neither end Nor intermission of his heavy scourge Granting till unredeemd no price required The black-eyed maid be to her father sent120 And a whole hecatomb in Chrysa bleed Then not before the God may be appeased He spake and sat; when Atreus son arose The Hero Agamemnon throned supreme Tempests of black resentment overcharged125 His heart and indignation fired his eyes On Calchas lowering him he first addressd Prophet of mischief! from whose tongue no note Of grateful sound to me was ever heard; Ill tidings are thy joy and tidings glad130 Thou tellst not or thy words come not to pass And now among the Danaxc3xaf thy dreams Divulging thou pretendst the Archer-God For his priests sake our enemy because I scornd his offerd ransom of the maid135 Chrysxc3xabis more desirous far to bear Her to my home for that she charms me more Than Clytemnestra my own first espoused With whom in disposition feature form Accomplishments she may be well compared140 Yet being such I will return her hence If that she go be best Perish myself But let the people of my charge be saved Prepare ye therefore a reward for me And seek it instant It were much unmeet145 That I alone of all the Argive host Should want due recompense whose former prize Is elsewhere destined as ye all perceive To whom Achilles matchless in the race Atrides glorious above all in rank150 And as intent on gain as thou art great Whence shall the Grecians give a prize to thee? The general stock is poor; the spoil of towns Which we have taken hath already passed In distribution and it were unjust155 To gather it from all the Greeks again But send thou back this Virgin to her God And when Joves favor shall have given us Troy A threefold fourfold share shall then be thine To whom the Sovereign of the host replied160 Godlike Achilles valiant as thou art Wouldst thou be subtle too? But me no fraud Shall overreach or art persuade of thine Wouldst thou that thou be recompensed and I Sit meekly down defrauded of my due?165 And didst thou bid me yield her? Let the bold Achaians give me competent amends Such as may please me and it shall be well Else if they give me none I will command Thy prize the prize of Ajax or the prize170 It may be of Ulysses to my tent And let the loser chafe But this concern Shall be adjusted at convenient time Come launch we now into the sacred deep A bark with lusty rowers well supplied;175 Then put on board Chrysxc3xabis and with her The sacrifice required Go also one High in authority some counsellor Idomeneus or Ajax or thyself Thou most untractable of all mankind;180 And seek by rites of sacrifice and prayer To appease Apollo on our hosts behalf Achilles eyed him with a frown and spake Ah! clothed with impudence as with a cloak And full of subtlety who thinkest thou 185 What Grecian here will serve thee or for thee Wage covert war or open? Me thou knowst Troy never wronged; I came not to avenge Harm done to me; no Trojan ever drove My pastures steeds or oxen took of mine190 Or plunderd of their fruits the golden fields Of Phthia13 the deep-soild She lies remote And obstacles are numerous interposed Vale-darkening mountains and the dashing sea No 14Shameless Wolf! For thy good pleasures sake195 We came and 15Face of flint! to avenge the wrongs By Menelaus and thyself sustaind On the offending Trojan service kind But lost on thee regardless of it all And now What now? Thy threatening is to seize200 Thyself the just requital of my toils My prize hard-earnd by common suffrage mine I never gain what Trojan town soeer We ransack half thy booty The swift march And furious onset these I largely reap205 But distribution made thy lot exceeds Mine far; while I with any pittance pleased Bear to my ships the little that I win After long battle and account it much But I am gone I and my sable barks210 (My wiser course) to Phthia and I judge Scornd as I am that thou shalt hardly glean Without me more than thou shalt soon consume16 He ceased and Agamemnon thus replied Fly and fly now; if in thy soul thou feel215 Such ardor of desire to go begone! I woo thee not to stay; stay not an hour On my behalf for I have others here Who will respect me more and above all All-judging Jove There is not in the host220 King or commander whom I hate as thee For all thy pleasure is in strife and blood And at all times; yet valor is no ground Whereon to boast it is the gift of Heaven Go get ye back to Phthia thou and thine!225 There rule thy Myrmidons17 I need not thee Nor heed thy wrath a jot But this I say Sure as Apollo takes my lovely prize Chrysxc3xabis and I shall return her home In mine own bark and with my proper crew230 So sure the fair Brisxc3xabis shall be mine I shall demand her even at thy tent So shalt thou well be taught how high in power I soar above thy pitch and none shall dare Attempt thenceforth comparison with me235 He ended and the big disdainful heart Throbbed of Achilles; racking doubt ensued And sore perplexd him whether forcing wide A passage through them with his blade unsheathed To lay Atrides breathless at his foot240 Or to command his stormy spirit down So doubted he and undecided yet Stood drawing forth his falchion huge; when lo! Down sent by Juno to whom both alike Were dear and who alike watched over both245 Pallas descended At his back she stood To none apparent save himself alone And seized his golden locks Startled he turned And instant knew Minerva Flashed her eyes Terrific;18 whom with accents on the wing250 Of haste incontinent he questioned thus Daughter of Jove why comest thou? that thyself Mayst witness these affronts which I endure From Agamemnon? Surely as I speak This moment for his arrogance he dies255 To whom the blue-eyed Deity From heaven Mine errand is to sooth if thou wilt hear Thine anger Juno the white-armd alike To him and thee propitious bade me down Restrain thy wrath Draw not thy falchion forth260 Retort and sharply and let that suffice For I foretell thee true Thou shalt receive Some future day thrice told thy present loss For this days wrong Cease therefore and be still To whom Achilles Goddess although much265 Exasperate I dare not disregard Thy word which to obey is always best19 Who hears the Gods the Gods hear also him He said; and on his silver hilt the force Of his broad hand impressing sent the blade270 Home to its rest nor would the counsel scorn Of Pallas She to heaven well-pleased returnd And in the mansion of Jove xc3x86gis20-armed Arriving mingled with her kindred Gods But though from violence yet not from words275 Abstained Achilles but with bitter taunt Opprobrious his antagonist reproached Oh charged with wine in steadfastness of face Dog unabashed and yet at heart a deer! Thou never when the troops have taken arms280 Hast dared to take thine also; never thou Associate with Achaias Chiefs to form The secret ambush21 No The sound of war Is as the voice of destiny to thee Doubtless the course is safer far to range285 Our numerous host and if a man have dared Dispute thy will to rob him of his prize King! over whom? Women and spiritless Whom therefore thou devourest; else themselves Would stop that mouth that it should scoff no more290 But hearken I shall swear a solemn oath By this same sceptre22 which shall never bud Nor boughs bring forth as once which having left Its stock on the high mountains at what time The woodmans axe lopped off its foliage green295 And stript its bark shall never grow again; Which now the judges of Achaia bear Who under Jove stand guardians of the laws By this I swear (mark thou the sacred oath) Time shall be when Achilles shall be missed;300 When all shall want him and thyself the power To help the Achaians whatsoeer thy will; When Hector at your heels shall mow you down The Hero-slaughtering Hector! Then thy soul Vexation-stung shall tear thee with remorse305 That thou hast scornd as he were nothing worth A Chief the soul and bulwark of your cause So saying he cast his sceptre on the ground Studded with gold and sat On the other side The son of Atreus all impassiond stood310 When the harmonious orator arose Nestor the Pylian oracle whose lips Dropped eloquence the honey not so sweet Two generations past of mortals born In Pylus coxc3xabtaneous with himself315 He governd now the third amid them all He stood and thus benevolent began Ah! what calamity hath falln on Greece!

What Prince or Chief of the degenerate race Now seen on earth who might with these compare?340 Yet even these would listen and conform To my advice in consultation given Which hear ye also; for compliance proves Oft times the safer and the manlier course Thou Agamemnon! valiant as thou art345 Seize not the maid his portion from the Greeks But leave her his; nor thou Achilles strive With our imperial Chief; for never King Had equal honor at the hands of Jove With Agamemnon or was throned so high350 Say thou art stronger and art Goddess-born How then? His territory passes thine And he is Lord of thousands more than thou Cease therefore Agamemnon; calm thy wrath; And it shall be mine office to entreat355 Achilles also to a calm whose might The chief munition is of all our host To whom the sovereign of the Greeks replied The son of Atreus Thou hast spoken well Old Chief and wisely But this wrangler here 360 Nought will suffice him but the highest place He must control us all reign over all Dictate to all; but he shall find at least One here disposed to question his commands If the eternal Gods have made him brave365 Derives he thence a privilege to rail? Whom thus Achilles interrupted fierce Could I be found so abject as to take The measure of my doings at thy lips Well might they call me coward through the camp370 A vassal and a fellow of no worth Give law to others Think not to control Me subject to thy proud commands no more Hear yet again! And weigh what thou shalt hear I will not strive with thee in such a cause375 Nor yet with any man; I scorn to fight For her whom having given ye take away But I have other precious things on board; Of those take none away without my leave Or if it please thee put me to the proof380 Before this whole assembly and my spear Shall stream that moment purpled with thy blood Thus they long time in opposition fierce Maintained the war of words; and now at length (The grand consult dissolved) Achilles walked385 (Patroclus and the Myrmidons his steps Attending) to his camp and to his fleet But Agamemnon orderd forth a bark A swift one manned with twice ten lusty rowers; He sent on board the Hecatomb24 he placed390 Chrysxc3xabis with the blooming cheeks himself And to Ulysses gave the freight in charge So all embarked and plowd their watery way Atrides next bade purify the host; The host was purified as he enjoind395 And the ablution cast into the sea Then to Apollo on the shore they slew Of the untillable and barren deep Whole Hecatombs of bulls and goats whose steam Slowly in smoky volumes climbed the skies400 Thus was the camp employed; nor ceased the while The son of Atreus from his threats denounced At first against Achilles but command Gave to Talthybius and Eurybates His heralds ever faithful to his will405 Haste Seek ye both the tent of Peleus son Achilles Thence lead hither by the hand Blooming Brisxc3xabis whom if he withhold Not her alone but other spoil myself Will take in person He shall rue the hour410 With such harsh message charged he them dismissed They sad and slow beside the barren waste Of Ocean to the galleys and the tents Moved of the Myrmidons Him there they found Beneath the shadow of his bark reclined415 Nor glad at their approach Trembling they stood In presence of the royal Chief awe-struck Nor questioned him or spake He not the less Knew well their embassy and thus began Ye heralds messengers of Gods and men420 Hail and draw near! I bid you welcome both I blame not you; the fault is his alone Who sends you to conduct the damsel hence Brisxc3xabis Go Patroclus generous friend!

Me when once I flew to save thee by the foot he seized And hurld me through the portal of the skies From morn to eve I fell a summers day 730 And dropped at last in Lemnos There half-dead The Sintians found me and with succor prompt And hospitable entertained me fallen So He; then Juno smiled Goddess white-armd And smiling still from his unwonted hand38735 Received the goblet He from right to left Rich nectar from the beaker drawn alert Distributed to all the powers divine Heaven rang with laughter inextinguishable Peal after peal such pleasure all conceived740 At sight of Vulcan in his new employ So spent they in festivity the day And all were cheered; nor was Apollos harp Silent nor did the Muses spare to add Responsive melody of vocal sweets745 But when the suns bright orb had now declined Each to his mansion wheresoever built By the lame matchless Architect withdrew39 Jove also kindler of the fires of heaven His couch ascending as at other times750 When gentle sleep approachd him slept serene With golden-sceptred Juno at his side The first book contains the preliminaries to the commencement of serious action First the visit of the priest of Apollo to ransom his captive daughter the refusal of Agamemnon to yield her up and the pestilence sent by the god upon the Grecian army in consequence Secondly the restoration the propitiation of Apollo the quarrel of Agamemnon and Achilles and the withdrawing of the latter from the Grecian army Thirdly the intercession of Thetis with Jupiter; his promise unwillingly given to avenge Achilles; and the assembly of the gods in which the promise is angrily alluded to by Juno and the discussion peremptorily checked by Jupiter The poet throughout this book maintains a simple unadorned style but highly descriptive and happily adapted to the nature of the subject Felton BOOK II ARGUMENT OF THE SECOND BOOK Jupiter in pursuance of his purpose to distress the Grecians in answer to the prayer of Thetis deceives Agamemnon by a dream He in consequence of it calls a council the result of which is that the army shall go forth to battle Thersites is mutinous and is chastised by Ulysses Ulysses Nestor and Agamemnon harangue the people; and preparation is made for battle An exact account follows of the forces on both sides BOOK II 1All night both Gods and Chiefs equestrian slept But not the Sire of all He waking soon Mused how to exalt Achilles and destroy No few in battle at the Grecian fleet This counsel at the last as best he chose5 And likeliest; to dispatch an evil Dream To Agamemnons tent and to his side The phantom summoning him thus addressed Haste evil Dream! Fly to the Grecian fleet And entering royal Agamemnons tent10 His ear possess thou thus omitting nought Of all that I enjoin thee Bid him arm His universal host for that the time When the Achaians shall at length possess Wide Ilium hath arrived The Gods above15 No longer dwell at variance The request Of Juno hath prevaild; now wo to Troy! So charged the Dream departed At the ships Well-built arriving of Achaias host He Agamemnon son of Atreus sought20 Him sleeping in his tent he found immersed In soft repose ambrosial At his head The shadow stood similitude exact Of Nestor son of Neleus; sage with whom In Agamemnons thought might none compare25 His form assumed the sacred Dream began Oh son of Atreus the renownd in arms And in the race! Sleepst thou? It ill behoves To sleep all night the man of high employ And charged as thou art with a peoples care30 Now therefore mark me well who sent from Jove Inform thee that although so far remote He yet compassionates and thinks on thee With kind solicitude He bids thee arm Thy universal host for that the time35 When the Achaians shall at length possess Wide Ilium hath arrived The Gods above No longer dwell at variance The requests Of Juno have prevaild Now wo to Troy From Jove himself! Her fate is on the wing40 Awaking from thy dewy slumbers hold In firm remembrance all that thou hast heard So spake the Dream and vanishing him left In false hopes occupied and musings vain Full sure he thought ignorant of the plan45 By Jove designd that day the last of Troy Fond thought! For toils and agonies to Greeks And Trojans both in many a bloody field To be endured the Thunderer yet ordaind Starting he woke and seeming still to hear50 The warning voice divine with hasty leap Sprang from his bed and sat2 His fleecy vest New-woven he put on and mantle wide; His sandals fair to his unsullied feet He braced and slung his argent-studded sword55 Then incorruptible for evermore The sceptre of his sires he took with which He issued forth into the camp of Greece Aurora now on the Olympian heights Proclaiming stood new day to all in heaven60 When he his clear-voiced heralds bade convene The Greeks in council Went the summons forth Into all quarters and the throng began First at the ship of Nestor Pylian King3 The senior Chiefs for high exploits renownd65 He gatherd whom he prudent thus addressd My fellow warriors hear! A dream from heaven Amid the stillness of the vacant night Approachd me semblance close in stature bulk And air of noble Nestor At mine head70 The shadow took his stand and thus he spake Oh son of Atreus the renownd in arms And in the race sleepst thou? It ill behoves To sleep all night the man of high employ And charged as thou art with a peoples care75 Now therefore mark me well who sent from Jove Inform thee that although so far remote He yet compassionates and thinks on thee With kind solicitude He bids thee arm Thy universal host; for that the time80 When the Achaians shall at length possess Wide Ilium hath arrived The Gods above No longer dwell at variance The requests Of Juno have prevaild Now wo to Troy From Jove himself! Her fate is on the wing85 Charge this on thy remembrance Thus he spake Then vanished suddenly and I awoke Haste therefore let us arm if arm we may4 The warlike sons of Greece; but first myself Will prove them recommending instant flight90 With all our ships and ye throughout the host Dispersed shall next encourage all to stay He ceased and sat; when in the midst arose Of highest fame for wisdom Nestor King Of sandy Pylus who them thus bespake95 Friends Counsellors and Leaders of the Greeks! Had any meaner Argive told his dream We had pronounced it false and should the more Have shrunk from battle; but the dream is his Who boasts himself our highest in command100 Haste arm we if we may the sons of Greece So saying he left the council; him at once The sceptred Chiefs obedient to his voice Arising followd; and the throng began As from the hollow rock bees stream abroad105 And in succession endless seek the fields Now clustering and now scattered far and near In spring-time among all the new-blown flowers So they to council swarmd troop after troop Grecians of every tribe from camp and fleet110 Assembling orderly oer all the plain Beside the shore of Ocean In the midst A kindling rumor messenger of Jove Impelld them and they went Loud was the din Of the assembling thousands; groand the earth115 When down they sat and murmurs ran around Nine heralds cried aloud Will ye restrain Your clamors that your heaven-taught Kings may speak? Scarce were they settled and the clang had ceased When Agamemnon sovereign oer them all120 Sceptre in hand arose (That sceptre erst Vulcan with labor forged and to the hand Consignd it of the King Saturnian Jove; Jove to the vanquisher5 of Inos6 guard And he to Pelops; Pelops in his turn125 To royal Atreus; Atreus at his death Bequeathd it to Thyestes rich in flocks And rich Thyestes left it to be borne By Agamemnon symbol of his right To empire over Argos and her isles)130 On that he leand and rapid thus began7 Friends Grecian Heroes ministers of Mars! Ye see me here entangled in the snares Of unpropitious Jove He promised once And with a nod confirmd it that with spoils135 Of Ilium laden we should hence return; But now devising ill he sends me shamed And with diminished numbers home to Greece So stands his sovereign pleasure who hath laid The bulwarks of full many a city low140 And more shall level matchless in his might That such a numerous host of Greeks as we Warring with fewer than ourselves should find No fruit of all our toil (and none appears) Will make us vile with ages yet to come145 For should we now strike truce till Greece and Troy Might number each her own and were the Greeks Distributed in bands ten Greeks in each Our banded decads should exceed so far Their units that all Troy could not supply150 For every ten a man to fill us wine; So far the Achaians in my thought surpass The native Trojans But in Troy are those Who baffle much my purpose; aids derived From other states spear-armd auxiliars firm155 In the defence of Iliums lofty towers Nine years have passed us over nine long years; Our ships are rotted and our tackle marrd And all our wives and little-ones at home Sit watching our return while this attempt160 Hangs still in doubt for which that home we left Accept ye then my counsel Fly we swift With all our fleet back to our native land Hopeless of Troy not yet to be subdued So spake the King whom all the concourse heard165 With minds in tumult tossd; all save the few Partners of his intent Commotion shook The whole assembly such as heaves the flood Of the Icarian Deep when South and East Burst forth together from the clouds of Jove170 And as when vehement the West-wind falls On standing corn mature the loaded ears Innumerable bow before the gale So was the council shaken With a shout All flew toward the ships; upraisd the dust175 Stood oer them; universal was the cry Now clear the passages strike down the props Set every vessel free launch and away! Heaven rang with exclamation of the host All homeward bent and launching glad the fleet180 Then baffled Fate had the Achaians seen Returning premature but Juno thus With admonition quick to Pallas spake Unconquerd daughter of Jove xc3x86gis-armd! Ah foul dishonor! Is it thus at last185 That the Achaians on the billows borne Shall seek again their country leaving here To be the vaunt of Ilium and her King Helen of Argos in whose cause the Greeks Have numerous perishd from their home remote?190 Haste! Seek the mail-armd multitude by force Detain them of thy soothing speech ere yet All launch their oary barks into the flood She spake nor did Minerva not comply But darting swift from the Olympian heights195 Reachd soon Achaias fleet There she perceived Prudent as Jove himself Ulysses; firm He stood; he touchd not even with his hand His sable bark for sorrow whelmd his soul The Athenxc3xa6an Goddess azure-eyed200 Beside him stood and thus the Chief bespake Laertes noble son for wiles renownd! Why seek ye thus precipitate your ships? Intend ye flight? And is it thus at last That the Achaians on the billows borne205 Shall seek again their country leaving here To be the vaunt of Ilium and her King Helen of Argos in whose cause the Greeks Have numerous perishd from their home remote? Delay not Rush into the throng; by force210 Detain them of thy soothing speech ere yet All launch their oary barks into the flood She ceased whom by her voice Ulysses knew Casting his mantle from him which his friend Eurybates the Ithacensian caught215 He ran; and in his course meeting the son Of Atreus Agamemnon from his hand The everlasting sceptre quick received Which bearing through Achaias fleet he passd What King soever or distinguishd Greek220 He found approaching to his side in terms Of gentle sort he stayd him Sir he cried It is unseemly that a man renownd As thou should tremble Go Resume the seat Which thou hast left and bid the people sit225 Thou knowst not clearly yet the monarchs mind He proves us now but soon he will chastize All were not present; few of us have heard His speech this day in council Oh beware Lest in resentment of this hasty course230 Irregular he let his anger loose Dread is the anger of a King; he reigns By Joves own ordinance and is dear to Jove But what plebeian base soeer he heard Stretching his throat to swell the general cry235 He laid the sceptre smartly on his back With reprimand severe Fellow he said Sit still; hear others; thy superiors hear For who art thou? A dastard and a drone Of none account in council or in arms240 By no means may we all alike bear sway At Ilium; such plurality of Kings Were evil One suffices One to whom The son of politic Saturn hath assignd The sceptre and inforcement of the laws245 That he may rule us as a monarch ought8 With such authority the troubled host He swayd; they quitting camp and fleet again Rushd back to council; deafening was the sound As when a billow of the boisterous deep250 Some broad beach dashes and the Ocean roars The host all seated and the benches filld Thersites only of loquacious tongue Ungovernd clamord mutinous; a wretch Of utterance prompt but in coarse phrase obscene255 Deep learnd alone with which to slander Kings Might he but set the rabble in a roar He cared not with what jest; of all from Greece To Ilium sent his countrys chief reproach Cross-eyed he was and halting moved on legs260 Ill-paird; his gibbous shoulders oer his breast Contracted pinchd it; to a peak his head Was moulded sharp and sprinkled thin with hair Of starveling length flimsy and soft as down Achilles and Ulysses had incurrd265 Most his aversion; them he never spared; But now imperial Agamemnon self In piercing accents stridulous he charged With foul reproach The Grecians with contempt Listend and indignation while with voice270 At highest pitch he thus the monarch mockd What wouldst thou now? Whereof is thy complaint Now Agamemnon? Thou hast filld thy tents With treasure and the Grecians when they take A city choose the loveliest girls for thee275 Is gold thy wish? More gold? A ransom brought By some chief Trojan for his sons release Whom I or other valiant Greek may bind? Or wouldst thou yet a virgin one by right Anothers claim but made by force thine own?280 It was not well great Sir that thou shouldst bring A plague on the Achaians as of late But come my Grecian sisters soldiers named Unfitly of a sex too soft for war Come let us homeward let him here digest285 What he shall gorge alone; that he may learn If our assistance profit him or not For when he shamed Achilles he disgraced A Chief far worthier than himself whose prize He now withholds But tush Achilles lacks290 Himself the spirit of a man; no gall Hath he within him or his hand long since Had stoppd that mouth9 that it should scoff no more Thus mocking royal Agamemnon spake Thersites Instant starting to his side 295 Noble Ulysses with indignant brows Surveyd him and him thus reproved severe Thersites! Railer! peace Think not thyself Although thus eloquent alone exempt From obligation not to slander Kings300 I deem thee most contemptible the worst Of Agamemnons followers to the war; Presume not then to take the names revered Of Sovereigns on thy sordid lips to asperse Their sacred character and to appoint305 The Greeks a time when they shall voyage home How soon how late with what success at last We shall return we know not but because Achaias heroes numerous spoils allot To Agamemnon Leader of the host310 Thou therefore from thy seat revilest the King But mark me If I find thee as even now Raving and foaming at the lips again May never man behold Ulysses head On these my shoulders more and may my son315 Prove the begotten of another Sire If I not strip thee to that hide of thine As bare as thou wast born and whip thee hence Home to thy galley sniveling like a boy He ceased and with his sceptre on the back320 And shoulders smote him Writhing to and fro He wept profuse while many a bloody whelk Protuberant beneath the sceptre sprang Awe-quelld he sat and from his visage mean Deep-sighing wiped the rheums It was no time325 For mirth yet mirth illumined every face And laughing thus they spake A thousand acts Illustrious both by well-concerted plans And prudent disposition of the host Ulysses hath achieved but this by far330 Transcends his former praise that he hath quelld Such contumelious rhetoric profuse The valiant talker shall not soon we judge Take liberties with royal names again10 So spake the multitude Then stretching forth335 The sceptre city-spoiler Chief arose Ulysses Him beside herald in form Appeared Minerva Silence she enjoined To all that all Achaias sons might hear Foremost and rearmost and might weigh his words340 He then his counsel prudent thus proposed Atrides! Monarch!

Senseless like them ye stand nor seek the fight Is it your purpose patient here to wait Till Troy invade your vessels on the shore Of the grey deep that ye may trial make290 Of Jove if he will prove himself your shield? Thus in discharge of his high office passd Atrides through the ranks and now arrived Where hardy Chief!

I move not you to duty; ye yourselves335 Move others and no lesson need from me Jove Pallas and Apollo! were but all Courageous as yourselves soon Priams towers Should totter and his Ilium stormd and sackd By our victorious bands stoop to the dust340 He ceased and still proceeding next arrived Where stood the Pylian orator his band Marshalling under all their leaders bold Alastor Chromius Pelagon the vast Hxc3xa6mon the prince and Bias martial Chief345 Chariot and horse he stationd in the front; His numerous infantry a strong reserve Right valiant in the rear; the worst and those In whom he trusted least he drove between That such through mere necessity might act350 First to his charioteers he gave in charge Their duty; bade them rein their horses hard Shunning confusion Let no warrior vain And overweening of his strength or skill Start from his rank to dare the fight alone355 Or fall behind it weakening whom he leaves 13And if dismounted from his own he climb Anothers chariot let him not affect Perverse the reins but let him stand his spear Advancing firm far better so employd360 Such was the discipline in ancient times Of our forefathers; by these rules they fought Successful and laid many a city low So counselld them the venerable Chief Long time expert in arms; him also saw365 King Agamemnon with delight and said Old Chief! ah how I wish that thy firm heart Were but supported by as firm a knee! But time unhinges all Oh that some youth Had thine old age and thou wast young again!370 To whom the valiant Nestor thus replied Atrides I could also ardent wish That I were now robust as when I struck Brave Ereuthalion14 breathless to the ground! But never all their gifts the Gods confer375 On man at once; if then I had the force Of youth I suffer now the effects of age Yet ancient as I am I will be seen Still mingling with the charioteers still prompt To give them counsel; for to counsel youth380 Is the old warriors province Let the green In years my juniors unimpaired by time Push with the lance for they have strength to boast So he whom Agamemnon joyful heard And passing thence the son of Peteos found385 Menestheus foremost in equestrian fame Among the brave Athenians; near to him Ulysses held his station and at hand The Cephallenians stood hardy and bold; For rumor none of the approaching fight390 Them yet had reachd so recent had the stir Arisen in either host; they therefore watchd Till the example of some other band Marching should prompt them to begin the fight But Agamemnon thus the King of men395 Them seeing sudden and severe reproved Menestheus son of Peteos prince renownd And thou deviser of all evil wiles! Adept in artifice! why stand ye here Appalld? why wait ye on this distant spot400 Till others move? I might expect from you More readiness to meet the burning war Whom foremost I invite of all to share The banquet when the Princes feast with me There ye are prompt; ye find it pleasant there405 To eat your savory food and quaff your wine Delicious till satiety ensue; But here you could be well content to stand Spectators only while ten Grecian troops Should wage before you the wide-wasting war410 To whom Ulysses with resentful tone Dark-frowning thus replied What words are these Which have escaped thy lips; and for what cause Atrides hast thou calld me slow to fight? When we of Greece shall in sharp contest clash415 With you steed-tamer Trojans mark me then; Then thou shalt see (if the concerns of war So nearly touch thee and thou so incline) The father of Telemachus engaged Among the foremost Trojans But thy speech420 Was light as is the wind and rashly made When him thus moved he saw the monarch smiled Complacent and in gentler terms replied Laxc3xabrtes noble son for wiles renownd! Short reprimand and exhortation short425 Suffice for thee nor did I purpose more For I have known thee long that thou art one Of kindest nature and so much my friend That we have both one heart Go therefore thou Lead on and if a word have fallen amiss430 We will hereafter mend it and may heaven Obliterate in thine heart its whole effect! He ceased and ranging still along the line The son of Tydeus Diomede perceived Heroic Chief by chariots all around435 Environd and by steeds at side of whom Stood Sthenelus the son of Capaneus Him also Agamemnon King of men In accents of asperity reproved Ah son of Tydeus Chief of dauntless heart440 And of equestrian fame! why standest thou Appalld and peering through the walks of war? So did not Tydeus In the foremost fight His favorite station was as they affirm Who witnessd his exploits; I never saw445 Or met him but by popular report He was the bravest warrior of his day Yet came he once but not in hostile sort To fair Mycenxc3xa6 by the godlike prince Attended Polynices at what time450 The host was called together and the siege Was purposed of the sacred city Thebes Earnest they sued for an auxiliar band Which we had gladly granted but that Jove By unpropitious tokens interfered455 So forth they went and on the reedy banks Arriving of Asopus there thy sire By designation of the Greeks was sent Ambassador and enterd Thebes He found In Eteocles palace numerous guests460 The sons of Cadmus feasting among whom Although a solitary stranger stood Thy father without fear and challenged forth Their best to cope with him in manly games Them Tydeus vanquishd easily such aid465 Pallas vouchsafed him Then the spur-armd race Of Cadmus was incensed and fifty youths In ambush close expected his return Them Lycophontes obstinate in fight Son of Autophonus and Mxc3xa6on son470 Of Hxc3xa6mon Chief of godlike stature led Those also Tydeus slew;

But thus the son of glorious Capaneus Atrides conscious of the truth speak truth480 We with our sires compared superior praise Claim justly15 We confiding in the aid Of Jove and in propitious signs from heaven Led to the city consecrate to Mars Our little host inferior far to theirs485 And took seven-gated Thebes under whose walls Our fathers by their own imprudence fell Their glory then match never more with ours He spake whom with a frowning brow the brave Tydides answerd Sthenelus my friend!490 I give thee counsel Mark it Hold thy peace If Agamemnon who hath charge of all Excite his well-appointed host to war He hath no blame from me For should the Greeks (Her people vanquished) win imperial Troy495 The glory shall be his; or if his host Oerpowerd in battle perish his the shame Come therefore; be it ours to rouse at once To action all the fury of our might He said and from his chariot to the plain500 Leapd ardent; rang the armor on the breast Of the advancing Chief;

So moved the Greeks successive rank by rank510 And phalanx after phalanx every Chief His loud command proclaiming while the rest As voice in all those thousands none had been Heard mute; and in resplendent armor clad With martial order terrible advanced515 Not so the Trojans came As sheep the flock Of some rich man by thousands in his court Pennd close at milking time incessant bleat Loud answering all their bleating lambs without Such din from Iliums wide-spread host arose520 Nor was their shout nor was their accent one But mingled languages were heard of men From various climes These Mars to battle roused Those Pallas azure-eyed;

Such was the thunder of the mingling hosts And first Antilochus a Trojan Chief Slew Echepolus from Thalysias sprung Contending valiant in the van of Troy545 Him smiting on his crested casque he drove The brazen lance into his front and pierced The bones within;

When Peleus hoary Chief Sent thee to Agamemnon yet a child13 Unpractised in destructive fight nor less545 Of councils ignorant the schools in which Great minds are formd he bade me to the war Attend thee forth that I might teach thee all Both elocution and address in arms Me therefore shalt thou not with my consent550 Leave here my son! no not would Jove himself Promise me reaping smooth this silver beard To make me downy-cheekd as in my youth; Such as when erst from Hellas beauty-famed I fled escaping from my fathers wrath555 Amyntor son of Ormenus who loved A beauteous concubine and for her sake Despised his wife and persecuted me My mother suppliant at my knees with prayer Perpetual importuned me to embrace560 The damsel first that she might loathe my sire I did so; and my father soon possessd With hot suspicion of the fact let loose A storm of imprecation in his rage Invoking all the Furies to forbid565 That ever son of mine should press his knees Tartarian Jove14 and dread Persephone Fulfilld his curses; with my pointed spear I would have pierced his heart but that my wrath Some Deity assuaged suggesting oft570 What shame and obloquy I should incur Known as a parricide through all the land At length so treated I resolved to dwell No longer in his house My friends indeed And all my kindred compassd me around575 With much entreaty wooing me to stay; Oxen and sheep they slaughterd many a plump Well-fatted brawn extended in the flames And drank the old mans vessels to the lees Nine nights continual at my side they slept580 While others watchd by turns nor were the fires Extinguishd ever one beneath the porch Of the barrd hall and one that from within The vestibule illumed my chamber door But when the tenth dark night at length arrived585 Sudden the chamber doors bursting I flew That moment forth and unperceived alike By guards and menial woman leapd the wall Through spacious Hellas flying thence afar I came at length to Phthia the deep-soild590 Mother of flocks and to the royal house Of Peleus; Peleus with a willing heart Receiving loved me as a father loves His only son the son of his old age Inheritor of all his large demesnes595 He made me rich; placed under my control A populous realm and on the skirts I dwelt Of Phthia ruling the Dolopian race Thee from my soul thou semblance of the Gods I loved and all illustrious as thou art600 Achilles! such I made thee For with me Me only wouldst thou forth to feast abroad Nor wouldst thou taste thy food at home till first I placed thee on my knees with my own hand Thy viands carved and fed thee and the wine605 Held to thy lips; and many a time in fits Of infant frowardness the purple juice Rejecting thou hast deluged all my vest And filld my bosom Oh I have endured Much and have also much performd for thee610 Thus purposing that since the Gods vouchsafd No son to me thyself shouldst be my son Godlike Achilles! who shouldst screen perchance From a foul fate my else unshelterd age Achilles! bid thy mighty spirit down615 Thou shouldst not be thus merciless;

the xc3x86tolian powers In the defence of Calydon the fair660 And the Curetes bent to lay it waste That strife Diana of the golden throne Kindled between them with resentment fired That Oeneus had not in some fertile spot The first fruits of his harvest set apart665 To her; with hecatombs he entertained All the Divinities of heaven beside And her alone daughter of Jove supreme Or through forgetfulness or some neglect Served not; omission careless and profane!670 She progeny of Jove Goddess shaft-armd A savage boar bright-tuskd in anger sent Which haunting Oeneus fields much havoc made Trees numerous on the earth in heaps he cast Uprooting them with all their blossoms on675 But Meleager Oeneus son at length Slew him the hunters gathering and the hounds Of numerous cities; for a boar so vast Might not be vanquishd by the power of few And many to their funeral piles he sent680 Then raised Diana clamorous dispute And contest hot between them all alike Curetes and xc3x86tolians fierce in arms The boars head claiming and his bristly hide So long as warlike Meleager fought685 xc3x86tolia prosperd nor with all their powers Could the Curetes stand before the walls But when resentment once had fired the heart Of Meleager which hath tumult oft Excited in the breasts of wisest men690 (For his own mother had his wrath provoked Althxc3xa6a) thenceforth with his wedded wife He dwelt fair Cleopatra close retired She was Marpessas daughter whom she bore To Idas bravest warrior in his day695 Of all on earth He feard not gainst the King Himself Apollo for the lovely nymph Marpessas sake his spouse to bend his bow Her therefore Idas and Marpessa named Thenceforth Alcyone because the fate700 Of sad Alcyone Marpessa shared And wept like her by Phxc5x93bus forced away Thus Meleager tortured with the pangs Of wrath indulged with Cleopatra dwelt Vexd that his mother cursed him; for with grief705 Frantic his mother importuned the Gods To avenge her slaughterd brothers17 on his head Oft would she smite the earth while on her knees Seated she filld her bosom with her tears And calld on Pluto and dread Proserpine710 To slay her son; nor vain was that request But by implacable Erynnis heard Roaming the shades of Erebus Ere long The tumult and the deafening din of war Roard at the gates and all the batterd towers715 Resounded Then the elders of the town Dispatchd the high-priests of the Gods to plead With Meleager for his instant aid With strong assurances of rich reward Where Calydon afforded fattest soil720 They bade him choose to his own use a farm Of fifty measured acres vineyard half And half of land commodious for the plow Him Oeneus also warrior grey with age Ascending to his chamber and his doors725 Smiting importunate with earnest prayers Assayd to soften kneeling to his son Nor less his sisters wood him to relent Nor less his mother; but in vain; he grew Still more obdurate His companions last730 The most esteemd and dearest of his friends The same suit urged yet he persisted still Relentless nor could even they prevail But when the battle shook his chamber-doors And the Curetes climbing the high towers735 Had fired the spacious city then with tears The beauteous Cleopatra and with prayers Assaild him; in his view she set the woes Numberless of a city stormd the men Slaughterd the city burnt to dust the chaste740 Matrons with all their children draggd away That dread recital roused him and at length Issuing he put his radiant armor on Thus Meleager gratifying first His own resentment from a fatal day745 Saved the xc3x86tolians who the promised gift Refused him and his toils found no reward But thou my son be wiser; follow thou No demon who would tempt thee to a course Like his; occasion more propitious far750 Smiles on thee now than if the fleet were fired Come while by gifts invited and receive From all the host the honors of a God; For shouldst thou by no gifts induced at last Enter the bloody field although thou chase755 The Trojans hence yet less shall be thy praise Then thus Achilles matchless in the race Phxc5x93nix my guide wise noble and revered! I covet no such glory! the renown Ordaind by Jove for me is to resist760 All importunity to quit my ships While I have power to move or breath to draw Hear now and mark me well Cease thou from tears Confound me not pleading with sighs and sobs In Agamemnons cause; O love not him765 Lest I renounce thee who am now thy friend Assist me rather as thy duty bids Him to afflict who hath afflicted me So shalt thou share my glory and my power These shall report as they have heard but here770 Rest thou this night and with the rising morn We will decide to stay or to depart He ceased and silent by a nod enjoind Patroclus to prepare an easy couch For Phxc5x93nix anxious to dismiss the rest775 Incontinent; when Ajax godlike son Of Telamon arising thus began Laertes noble son for wiles renownd Depart we now; for I perceive that end Or fruit of all our reasonings shall be none780 It is expedient also that we bear Our answer back (unwelcome as it is) With all dispatch for the assembled Greeks Expect us Brave Achilles shuts a fire Within his breast; the kindness of his friends785 And the respect peculiar by ourselves Shown to him on his heart work no effect Inexorable man! others accept Even for a brother slain or for a son Due compensation;18 the delinquent dwells790 Secure at home and the receiver soothed And pacified represses his revenge But thou resentful of the loss of one One virgin (such obduracy of heart The Gods have given thee) canst not be appeased795 Yet we assign thee seven in her stead The most distinguishd of their sex and add Large gifts beside Ah then at last relent!

To whom the Sovereign of the host replied There stay; lest striking into different paths75 (For many passes intersect the camp) We miss each other; summon them aloud Where thou shalt come; enjoin them to arise; Call each by his hereditary name Honoring all Beware of manners proud80 For we ourselves must labor at our birth By Jove ordaind to suffering and to toil So saying he his brother thence dismissd Instructed duly and himself his steps Turned to the tent of Nestor Him he found85 Amid his sable galleys in his tent Reposing soft his armor at his side Shield spears bright helmet and the broiderd belt Which when the Senior armd led forth his host To fight he wore; for he complied not yet90 With the encroachments of enfeebling age He raised his head and on his elbow proppd Questioning Agamemnon thus began But who art thou who thus alone the camp Roamest amid the darkness of the night95 While other mortals sleep? Comest thou abroad Seeking some friend or soldier of the guard? Speak come not nearer mute What is thy wish? To whom the son of Atreus King of men Oh Nestor glory of the Grecian name100 Offspring of Neleus! thou in me shalt know The son of Atreus Agamemnon doomd By Jove to toil while life shall yet inform These limbs or I shall draw the vital air I wander thus because that on my lids105 Sweet sleep sits not but war and the concerns Of the Achaians occupy my soul Terrible are the fears which I endure For these my people; such as supersede All thought; my bosom can no longer hold110 My throbbing heart and tremors shake my limbs But if thy mind more capable project Aught that may profit us (for thee it seems Sleep also shuns) arise and let us both Visit the watch lest haply overtoild115 They yield to sleep forgetful of their charge The foe is posted near and may intend (None knows his purpose) an assault by night To him Gerenian Nestor thus replied Illustrious Agamemnon King of men!120 Deep-planning Jove the imaginations proud Of Hector will not ratify nor all His sanguine hopes effectuate; in his turn He also (fierce Achilles once appeased) Shall trouble feel and haply more than we125 But with all readiness I will arise And follow thee that we may also rouse Yet others; Diomede the spear-renownd Ulysses the swift Ajax and the son Of Phyleus valiant Meges It were well130 Were others also visited and calld The godlike Ajax and Idomeneus Whose ships are at the camps extremest bounds But though I love thy brother and revere And though I grieve een thee yet speak I must135 And plainly censure him that thus he sleeps And leaves to thee the labor who himself Should range the host soliciting the Chiefs Of every band as utmost need requires Him answerd Agamemnon King of men140 Old warrior times there are when I could wish Myself thy censure of him for in act He is not seldom tardy and remiss Yet is not sluggish indolence the cause No nor stupidity but he observes145 Me much expecting till I lead the way But he was foremost now far more alert This night than I and I have sent him forth Already those to call whom thou hast named But let us hence for at the guard I trust150 To find them since I gave them so in charge3 To whom the brave Gerenian Chief replied Him none will censure or his will dispute Whom he shall waken and exhort to rise So saying he bound his corselet to his breast155 His sandals fair to his unsullied feet And fastening by its clasps his purple cloak Around him double and of shaggy pile Seized next his sturdy spear headed with brass And issued first into the Grecian fleet160 There Nestor brave Gerenian with a voice Sonorous roused the godlike counsellor From sleep Ulysses; the alarm came oer His startled ear forth from his tent he sprang Sudden and of their coming quick inquired165 Why roam ye thus the camp and fleet alone In darkness? by what urgent need constraind? To whom the hoary Pylian thus replied Laertes noble son for wiles renownd! Resent it not for dread is our distress170 Come therefore and assist us to convene Yet others qualified to judge if war Be most expedient or immediate flight He ended and regaining quick his tent Ulysses slung his shield then coming forth175 Joind them The son of Tydeus first they sought Him sleeping armd before his tent they found Encompassd by his friends also asleep; His head each rested on his shield and each Had planted on its nether point4 erect180 His spear beside him; bright their polishd heads As Joves own lightning glittered from afar Himself the Hero slept A wild bulls hide Was spread beneath him and on arras tinged With splendid purple lay his head reclined185 Nestor beside him standing with his heel Shook him and urgent thus the Chief reproved Awake Tydides! wherefore givest the night Entire to balmy slumber? Hast not heard How on the rising ground beside the fleet190 The Trojans sit small interval between? He ceased; then up sprang Diomede alarmd Instant and in wingd accents thus replied Old wakeful Chief! thy toils are never done Are there not younger of the sons of Greece195 Who ranging in all parts the camp might call The Kings to council? But no curb controls Or can abate activity like thine To whom Gerenian Nestor in return My friend! thou hast well spoken I have sons200 And they are well deserving; I have here A numerous people also one of whom Might have sufficed to call the Kings of Greece But such occasion presses now the host As hath not oft occurrd; the overthrow205 Complete or full deliverance of us all In balance hangs poised on a razors edge But haste and if thy pity of my toils Be such since thou art younger call thyself Ajax the swift and Meges to the guard210 Then Diomede a lions tawny skin Around him wrappd dependent to his heels And spear in hand set forth The Hero calld Those two and led them whither Nestor bade They at the guard arrived not sleeping found215 The captains of the guard but sitting all In vigilant posture with their arms prepared As dogs that careful watch the fold by night Hearing some wild beast in the woods5 which hounds And hunters with tumultuous clamor drive220 Down from the mountain-top all sleep forego; So sat not on their eyelids gentle sleep That dreadful night but constant to the plain At every sound of Trojan feet they turnd The old Chief joyful at the sight in terms225 Of kind encouragement them thus addressd So watch my children! and beware that sleep Invade none here lest all become a prey So saying he traversed with quick pace the trench By every Chief whom they had thither calld230 Attended with whom Nestors noble son Went and Meriones invited both To join their consultation From the foss Emerging in a vacant space they sat Unstrewd with bodies of the slain the spot235 Whence furious Hector after slaughter made Of numerous Greeks night falling had returnd There seated mutual converse close they held And Nestor brave Gerenian thus began Oh friends! hath no Achaian here such trust240 In his own prowess as to venture forth Among yon haughty Trojans? He perchance Might on the borders of their host surprise Some wandering adversary or might learn Their consultations whether they propose245 Here to abide in prospect of the fleet Or satiate with success against the Greeks So signal meditate retreat to Troy These tidings gaind should he at last return Secure his recompense will be renown250 Extensive as the heavens and fair reward From every leader of the fleet his gift Shall be a sable6 ewe and sucking lamb Rare acquisition! and at every board And sumptuous banquet he shall be a guest255 He ceased and all sat silent when at length The mighty son of Tydeus thus replied Me Nestor my courageous heart incites To penetrate into the neighbor host Of enemies; but went some other Chief260 With me far greater would my comfort prove And I should dare the more Two going forth One quicker sees than other and suggests Prudent advice; but he who single goes Mark whatsoeer he may the occasion less265 Improves and his expedients soon exhausts He ended and no few willing arose To go with Diomede Servants of Mars Each Ajax willing stood; willing as they Meriones; most willing Nestors son;270 Willing the brother of the Chief of all Nor willing less Ulysses to explore The host of Troy for he possessd a heart Delighted ever with some bold exploit Then Agamemnon King of men began275 Now Diomede in whom my soul delights! Choose whom thou wilt for thy companion; choose The fittest here; for numerous wish to go Leave not through deference to anothers rank The more deserving nor prefer a worse280 Respecting either pedigree or power Such speech he interposed fearing his choice Of Menelaus; then renownd in arms The son of Tydeus rising spake again Since then ye bid me my own partner choose285 Free from constraint how can I overlook Divine Ulysses whose courageous heart With such peculiar cheerfulness endures Whatever toils and whom Minerva loves? Let _him_ attend me and through fire itself290 We shall return; for none is wise as he7 To him Ulysses hardy Chief replied Tydides! neither praise me much nor blame For these are Grecians in whose ears thou speakst And know me well But let us hence! the night295 Draws to a close; day comes apace; the stars Are far advanced; two portions have elapsed Of darkness but the third is yet entire So they; then each his dreadful arms put on To Diomede who at the fleet had left300 His own the dauntless Thrasymedes gave His shield and sword two-edged and on his head Placed crestless unadornd his bull-skin casque It was a striplings helmet such as youths Scarce yet confirmd in lusty manhood wear305 Meriones with quiver bow and sword Furnishd Ulysses and his brows enclosed In his own casque of hide with many a thong Well braced within;8 guarded it was without With boars teeth ivory-white inherent firm310 On all sides and with woolen head-piece lined That helmet erst Autolycus9 had brought From Eleon city of Amyntor son Of Hormenus where he the solid walls Bored through clandestine of Amyntors house315 He on Amphidamas the prize bestowd In Scandia;10 from Amphidamas it passd To Molus as a hospitable pledge; He gave it to Meriones his son And now it guarded shrewd Ulysses brows320 Both clad in arms terrific forth they sped Leaving their fellow Chiefs and as they went A heron by command of Pallas flew Close on the right beside them; darkling they Discernd him not but heard his clanging plumes11325 Ulysses in the favorable sign Exulted and Minerva thus invoked12 Oh hear me daughter of Jove xc3x86gis-armd! My present helper in all straits whose eye Marks all my ways oh with peculiar care330 Now guard me Pallas! grant that after toil Successful glorious such as long shall fill With grief the Trojans we may safe return And with immortal honors to the fleet Valiant Tydides next his prayer preferrd335 Hear also me Joves offspring by the toils Of war invincible! me follow now As my heroic father erst to Thebes Thou followedst Tydeus; by the Greeks dispatchd Ambassador he left the mail-clad host340 Beside Asopus and with terms of peace Entrusted enterd Thebes; but by thine aid Benevolent and in thy strength performd Returning deeds of terrible renown Thus now protect me also! In return345 I vow an offering at thy shrine a young Broad-fronted heifer to the yoke as yet Untamed whose horns I will incase with gold Such prayer they made and Pallas heard well pleased Their orisons ended to the daughter dread350 Of mighty Jove lion-like they advanced Through shades of night through carnage arms and blood Nor Hector to his gallant host indulged Sleep but convened the leaders; leader none Or senator of all his host he left355 Unsummond and his purpose thus promulged Where is the warrior who for rich reward Such as shall well suffice him will the task Adventurous which I propose perform? A chariot with two steeds of proudest height360 Surpassing all in the whole fleet of Greece Shall be his portion with immortal praise Who shall the well-appointed ships approach Courageous there to learn if yet a guard As heretofore keep them or if subdued365 Beneath us the Achaians flight intend And worn with labor have no will to watch So Hector spake but answer none returnd There was a certain Trojan Dolon named13 Son of Eumedes herald of the Gods370 Rich both in gold and brass but in his form Unsightly; yet the man was swift of foot Sole brother of five sisters; he his speech To Hector and the Trojans thus addressd My spirit Hector prompts me and my mind375 Endued with manly vigor to approach Yon gallant ships that I may tidings hear But come For my assurance lifting high Thy sceptre swear to me for my reward The horses and the brazen chariot bright380 Which bear renownd Achilles oer the field I will not prove a useless spy nor fall Below thy best opinion; pass I will Their army through till I shall reach the ship Of Agamemnon where the Chiefs perchance385 Now sit consulting or to fight or fly14 Then raising high his sceptre Hector sware Know Jove himself Junos high-thundering spouse! That Trojan none shall in that chariot ride By those steeds drawn save Dolon; on my oath390 I make them thine; enjoy them evermore He said and falsely sware yet him assured Then Dolon instant oer his shoulder slung His bow elastic wrappd himself around With a grey wolf-skin to his head a casque395 Adjusted coated oer with ferrets felt And seizing his sharp javelin from the host Turnd right toward the fleet but was ordaind To disappoint his sender and to bring No tidings thence The throng of Trojan steeds400 And warriors left with brisker pace he moved When brave Ulysses his approach perceived And thus to Diomede his speech addressd Tydides! yonder man is from the host; Either a spy he comes or with intent405 To spoil the dead First freely let him pass Few paces then pursuing him with speed Seize on him suddenly; but should he prove The nimbler of the three with threatening spear Enforce him from his camp toward the fleet410 Lest he elude us and escape to Troy So they; then turning from the road oblique Among the carcases each laid him down Dolon suspecting nought ran swiftly by 15But when such space was interposed as mules415 Plow in a day (for mules the ox surpass Through fallows deep drawing the ponderous plow) Both ran toward him Dolon at the sound Stood; for he hoped some Trojan friends at hand From Hector sent to bid him back again420 But when within spears cast or less they came Knowing them enemies he turnd to flight Incontinent whom they as swift pursued As two fleet hounds sharp fangd traind to the chase Hang on the rear of flying hind or hare425 And drive her never swerving from the track Through copses close; she screaming scuds before; So Diomede and dread Ulysses him Chased constant intercepting his return And now fast-fleeting to the ships he soon430 Had reachd the guard but Pallas with new force Inspired Tydides lest a meaner Greek Should boast that he had smitten Dolon first And Diomede win only second praise He poised his lifted spear and thus exclaimd435 Stand! or my spear shall stop thee Death impends At every step; thou canst not scape me long He said and threw his spear but by design Errd from the man The polishd weapon swift Oer-glancing his right shoulder in the soil440 Stood fixt beyond him Terrified he stood Stammering and sounding through his lips the clash Of chattering teeth with visage deadly wan They panting rushd on him and both his hands Seized fast; he wept and suppliant them bespake445 Take me alive and I will pay the price Of my redemption I have gold at home Brass also and bright steel and when report Of my captivity within your fleet Shall reach my father treasures he will give450 Not to be told for ransom of his son To whom Ulysses politic replied Take courage; entertain no thought of death16 But haste! this tell me and disclose the truth Why thus toward the ships comest thou alone455 From yonder host by night while others sleep? To spoil some carcase? or from Hector sent A spy of all that passes in the fleet? Or by thy curiosity impelld? Then Dolon his limbs trembling thus replied460 To my great detriment and far beyond My own design Hector trepannd me forth Who promised me the steeds of Peleus son Illustrious and his brazen chariot bright He bade me under nights fast-flitting shades465 Approach our enemies a spy to learn If still as heretofore ye station guards For safety of your fleet or if subdued Completely ye intend immediate flight And worn with labor have no will to watch470 To whom Ulysses smiling thus replied Thou hadst in truth an appetite to gifts Of no mean value coveting the steeds Of brave xc3x86acides; but steeds are they Of fiery sort difficult to be ruled475 By force of mortal man Achilles self Except whom an immortal mother bore But tell me yet again; use no disguise; Where leftst thou at thy coming forth your Chief The valiant Hector? where hath he disposed480 His armor battle-worn and where his steeds? What other quar4ers of your host are watchd? Where lodge the guard and what intend ye next? Still to abide in prospect of the fleet? Or well-content that ye have thus reduced485 Achaias host will ye retire to Troy? To whom this answer Dolon straight returned Son of Eumedes With unfeigning truth Simply and plainly will I utter all Hector with all the Senatorial Chiefs490 Beside the tomb of sacred Ilius sits Consulting from the noisy camp remote But for the guards Hero! concerning whom Thou hast inquired there is no certain watch And regular appointed oer the camp;495 The native17 Trojans (for _they_ can no less) Sit sleepless all and each his next exhorts To vigilance; but all our foreign aids Who neither wives nor children hazard here Trusting the Trojans for that service sleep500 To whom Ulysses ever wise replied How sleep the strangers and allies? apart? Or with the Trojans mingled? I would learn So spake Ulysses; to whom Dolon thus Son of Eumedes I will all unfold505 And all most truly By the sea are lodged The Carians the Pxc3xa6onians armd with bows The Leleges with the Pelasgian band And the Caucones On the skirts encamp Of Thymbra the Mxc3xa6onians crested high510 The Phrygian horsemen with the Lycian host And the bold troop of Mysias haughty sons But wherefore these inquiries thus minu4e? For if ye wish to penetrate the host These who possess the borders of the camp515 Farthest removed of all are Thracian powers Newly arrived; among them Rhesus sleeps Son of Exc3xafoneus their Chief and King His steeds I saw the fairest by these eyes Ever beheld and loftiest; snow itself520 They pass in whiteness and in speed the winds With gold and silver all his chariot burns And he arrived in golden armor clad Stupendous! little suited to the state Of mortal man fit for a God to wear!525 Now either lead me to your gallant fleet Or where ye find me leave me straitly bound Till ye return and after trial made Shall know if I have spoken false or true But him brave Diomede with aspect stern530 Answerd Since Dolon! thou art caught although Thy tidings have been good hope not to live; For should we now release thee and dismiss Thou wilt revisit yet again the fleet A spy or open foe; but smitten once535 By this death-dealing arm thou shall return To render mischief to the Greeks no more He ceased and Dolon would have stretchd his hand Toward his beard and pleaded hard for life But with his falchion rising to the blow540 On the mid-neck he smote him cutting sheer Both tendons with a stroke so swift that ere His tongue had ceased his head was in the dust18 They took his helmet clothed with ferrets felt Strippd off his wolf-skin seized his bow and spear545 And brave Ulysses lifting in his hand The trophy to Minerva prayd and said Hail Goddess; these are thine! for thee of all Who in Olympus dwell we will invoke First to our aid Now also guide our steps550 Propitious to the Thracian tents and steeds He ceased and at arms-length the lifted spoils Hung on a tamarisk; but markd the spot Plucking away with handful grasp the reeds And spreading boughs lest they should seek the prize555 Themselves in vain returning ere the night Swift traveller should have fled before the dawn Thence oer the bloody champain strewd with arms Proceeding to the Thracian lines they came They wearied slept profound; beside them lay560 In triple order regular arranged Their radiant armor and their steeds in pairs Amid them Rhesus slept and at his side His coursers to the outer chariot-ring Fastend secure Ulysses saw him first565 And seeing markd him out to Diomede Behold the man Tydides! Lo! the steeds By Dolon specified whom we have slain Be quick Exert thy force Armd as thou art Sleep not Loose thou the steeds or slaughter thou570 The Thracians and the steeds shall be my care He ceased; then blue-eyed Pallas with fresh force Invigord Diomede From side to side He slew; dread groans arose of dying men Hewn with the sword and the earth swam with blood575 As if he find a flock unguarded sheep Or goats the lion rushes on his prey With such unsparing force Tydides smote The men of Thrace till he had slaughterd twelve; And whom Tydides with his falchion struck580 Laertes son draggd by his feet abroad Forecasting that the steeds might pass with ease Nor start as yet uncustomd to the dead But when the son of Tydeus found the King Him also panting forth his last last breath585 He added to the twelve; for at his head An evil dream that night had stood the form Of Diomede by Pallas art devised Meantime the bold Ulysses loosed the steeds Which to each other reind he drove abroad590 Smiting them with his bow (for of the scourge He thought not in the chariot-seat secured) And as he went hissd warning Diomede But he projecting still some hardier deed Stood doubtful whether by the pole to draw595 The chariot thence laden with gorgeous arms Or whether heaving it on high to bear The burthen off or whether yet to take More Thracian lives; when him with various thoughts Perplexd Minerva drawing near bespake600 Son of bold Tydeus! think on thy return To yonder fleet lest thou depart constraind Some other God may rouse the powers of Troy She ended and he knew the voice divine At once he mounted With his bow the steeds605 Ulysses plyed and to the ships they flew Nor lookd the bender of the silver bow Apollo forth in vain but at the sight Of Pallas following Diomede incensed Descended to the field where numerous most610 He saw the Trojans and the Thracian Chief And counsellor Hippocoxc3xb6n aroused19 Kinsman of Rhesus and renownd in arms He starting from his sleep soon as he saw The spot deserted where so lately lay615 Those fiery coursers and his warrior friends Gasping around him sounded loud the name Of his loved Rhesus Instant at the voice Wild stir arose and clamorous uproar Of fast-assembling Trojans Deeds they saw 620 Terrible deeds and marvellous performd But not their authors they had sought the ships Meantime arrived where they had slain the spy Of Hector there Ulysses dear to Jove The coursers stayd and leaping to the ground625 The son of Tydeus in Ulysses hands The arms of Dolon placed foul with his blood Then vaulted light into his seat again He lashd the steeds they not unwilling flew To the deep-bellied barks as to their home630 First Nestor heard the sound and thus he said Friends! Counsellors! and leaders of the Greeks! False shall I speak or true? but speak I must The echoing sound of hoofs alarms my ear Oh that Ulysses and brave Diomede635 This moment might arrive drawn into camp By Trojan steeds! But ah the dread I feel! Lest some disaster have for ever quelld In yon rude host those noblest of the Greeks He hath not ended when themselves arrived640 Both quick dismounted; joy at their return Filld every bosom; each with kind salute Cordial and right-hand welcome greeted them And first Gerenian Nestor thus inquired Oh Chief by all extolld glory of Greece645 Ulysses! how have ye these steeds acquired? In yonder host? or met ye as ye went Some God who gave them to you? for they show A lustre dazzling as the beams of day Old as I am I mingle yet in fight650 With Iliums sons lurk never in the fleet Yet saw I at no time or have remarkd Steeds such as these; which therefore I believe Perforce that ye have gained by gift divine; For cloud-assembler Jove and azure-eyed655 Minerva Joves own daughter love you both To whom Ulysses thus discreet replied Neleian Nestor glory of the Greeks! A God so willing could have given us steeds Superior for their bounty knows no bounds660 But venerable Chief! these which thou seest Are Thracians new-arrived Their master lies Slain by the valiant Diomede with twelve The noblest of his warriors at his side A thirteenth20 also at small distance hence665 We slew by Hector and the Chiefs of Troy Sent to inspect the posture of our host He said; then high in exultation drove The coursers oer the trench and with him passd The glad Achaians; at the spacious tent670 Of Diomede arrived with even thongs They tied them at the cribs where stood the steeds Of Tydeus son with winnowd wheat supplied Ulysses in his bark the gory spoils Of Dolon placed designing them a gift675 To Pallas Then descending to the sea Neck thighs and legs from sweat profuse they cleansed And so refreshd and purified their last Ablution in bright tepid baths performd Each thus completely laved and with smooth oil680 Anointed at the well-spread board they sat And quaffd in honor of Minerva wine Delicious from the brimming beaker drawn The vividness of the scenes presented to us in this Book constitute its chief beauty The reader sees the most natural night-scene in the world He is led step by step with the adventurers and made the companion of all their expectations and uncertainties We see the very color of the sky; know the time to a minute; are impatient while the heroes are arming; our imagination follows them knows all their doubts and even the secret wishes of their hearts sent up to Minerva We are alarmed at the approach of Dolon hear his very footsteps assist the two chiefs in pursuing him and stop just with the spear that arrests him We are perfectly acquainted with the situation of all the forces with the figure in which they lie with the disposition of Rhesus and the Thracians with the posture of his chariot and horses The marshy spot of ground where Dolon is killed the tamarisk or aquatic plant upon which they hung his spoils and the reeds that are heaped together to mark the place are circumstances the most picturesque imaginable BOOK XI ARGUMENT OF THE ELEVENTH BOOK Agamemnon distinguishes himself He is wounded and retires Diomede is wounded by Paris; Ulysses by Socus Ajax with Menelaus flies to the relief of Ulysses and Eurypylus soon after to the relief of Ajax While he is employed in assisting Ajax he is shot in the thigh by Paris who also wounds Machaon Nestor conveys Machaon from the field Achilles dispatches Patroclus to the tent of Nestor and Nestor takes that occasion to exhort Patroclus to engage in battle clothed in the armor of Achilles BOOK XI Aurora from Tithonus side arose With light for heaven and earth when Jove dispatchd Discord the fiery signal in her hand Of battle bearing to the Grecian fleet High on Ulysses huge black ship she stood5 The centre of the fleet whence all might hear The tent of Telamons huge son between And of Achilles; for confiding they In their heroic fortitude their barks Well-poised had stationd utmost of the line10 There standing shrill she sent a cry abroad Among the Achaians such as thirst infused Of battle ceaseless into every breast All deemd at once war sweeter than to seek Their native country through the waves again15 Then with loud voice Atrides bade the Greeks Gird on their armor and himself his arms Took radiant First around his legs he claspd His shining greaves with silver studs secured Then bound his corselet to his bosom gift20 Of Cynyras long since;1 for rumor loud Had Cyprus reached of an Achaian host Assembling destined to the shores of Troy Wherefore to gratify the King of men He made the splendid ornament his own25 Ten rods of steel cxc5x93rulean all around Embraced it twelve of gold twenty of tin; Six2 spiry serpents their uplifted heads Cxc5x93rulean darted at the wearers throat Splendor diffusing as the various bow30 Fixd by Saturnian Jove in showery clouds A sign to mortal men3 He slung his sword Athwart his shoulders; dazzling bright it shone With gold embossd and silver was the sheath Suspended graceful in a belt of gold35 His massy shield oershadowing him whole High-wrought and beautiful he next assumed Ten circles bright of brass around its field Extensive circle within circle ran; The central boss was black but hemmd about40 With twice ten bosses of resplendent tin There dreadful ornament!

then all marshalld as they were From van to rear our legions took repast And at the rivers side slept on their arms Already the Epean host had round Begirt the city bent to lay it waste885 A task which cost them first both blood and toil For when the radiant sun on the green earth Had risen with prayer to Pallas and to Jove We gave them battle When the Pylian host And the Epeans thus were close engaged890 I first a warrior slew Mulius the brave And seized his coursers He the eldest-born Of King Augeias daughters had espoused The golden Agamede; not an herb The spacious earth yields but she knew its powers895 Him rushing on me with my brazen lance I smote and in the dust he fell; I leapd Into his seat and drove into the van A panic seized the Epeans when they saw The leader of their horse oerthrown a Chief900 Surpassing all in fight Black as a cloud With whirlwind fraught I drove impetuous on Took fifty chariots and at side of each Lay two slain warriors with their teeth the soil Grinding all vanquishd by my single arm905 I had slain also the Molions sons Of Actor but the Sovereign of the deep Their own authentic Sire in darkness dense Involving both conveyd them safe away Then Jove a victory of prime renown910 Gave to the Pylians; for we chased and slew And gatherd spoil oer all the champain spread With scatterd shields till we our steeds had driven To the Buprasian fields laden with corn To the Olenian rock and to a town915 In fair Colona situate and named Alesia There it was that Pallas turnd Our people homeward; there I left the last Of all the slain and he was slain by me Then drove the Achaians from Buprasium home920 Their coursers fleet and Jove of Gods above Received most praise Nestor of men below Such once was I But brave Achilles shuts His virtues close an unimparted store; Yet even he shall weep when all the host925 His fellow-warriors once shall be destroyd But recollect young friend! the sage advice Which when thou earnest from Phthia to the aid Of Agamemnon on that selfsame day Menxc5x93tius gave thee We were present there930 Ulysses and myself both in the house And heard it all; for to the house we came Of Peleus in our journey through the land Of fertile Greece gathering her states to war We found thy noble sire Menxc5x93tius there935 Thee and Achilles; ancient Peleus stood To Jove the Thunderer offering in his court Thighs of an ox and on the blazing rites Libation pouring from a cup of gold While ye on preparation of the feast940 Attended both Ulysses and myself Stood in the vestibule; Achilles flew Toward us introduced us by the hand And seating us such liberal portion gave To each as hospitality requires945 Our thirst at length and hunger both sufficed I foremost speaking askd you to the wars And ye were eager both but from your sires Much admonition ere ye went received Old Peleus charged Achilles to aspire950 To highest praise and always to excel But thee thy sire Menxc5x93tius thus advised My son! Achilles boasts the nobler birth But thou art elder; he in strength excels Thee far; thou therefore with discretion rule955 His inexperience; thy advice impart With gentleness; instruction wise suggest Wisely and thou shalt find him apt to learn So thee thy father taught but as it seems In vain Yet even now essay to move960 Warlike Achilles; if the Gods so please Who knows but that thy reasons may prevail To rouse his valiant heart? men rarely scorn The earnest intercession of a friend But if some prophecy alarm his fears965 And from his Goddess mother he have aught Received who may have learnt the same from Jove Thee let him send at least and order forth With thee the Myrmidons; a dawn of hope Shall thence it may be on our host arise970 And let him send thee to the battle clad In his own radiant armor; Troy deceived By such resemblance shall abstain perchance From conflict and the weary Greeks enjoy Short respite; it is all that war allows975 Fresh as ye are ye by your shouts alone May easily repulse an army spent With labor from the camp and from the fleet Thus Nestor and his mind bent to his words Back to xc3x86acides through all the camp980 He ran; and when still running he arrived Among Ulysses barks where they had fixd The forum where they ministerd the laws And had erected altars to the Gods There him Eurypylus Evxc3xa6mons son985 Illustrious met deep-wounded in his thigh And halting-back from battle From his head The sweat and from his shoulders ran profuse And from his perilous wound the sable blood Continual streamd; yet was his mind composed990 Him seeing Menxc5x93tiades the brave Compassion felt and mournful thus began Ah hapless senators and Chiefs of Greece! Left ye your native country that the dogs Might fatten on your flesh at distant Troy?995 But tell me Hero! say Eurypylus! Have the Achaians power still to withstand The enormous force of Hector or is this The moment when his spear must pierce us all? To whom Eurypylus discreet replied1000 Patroclus dear to Jove! there is no help No remedy We perish at our ships The warriors once most strenuous of the Greeks Lie wounded in the fleet by foes whose might Increases ever But thyself afford1005 To me some succor; lead me to my ship; Cut forth the arrow from my thigh; the gore With warm ablution cleanse and on the wound Smooth unguents spread the same as by report Achilles taught thee; taught himself their use1010 By Chiron Centaur justest of his kind For Podalirius and Machaon both Are occupied Machaon as I judge Lies wounded in his tent needing like aid Himself and Podalirius in the field1015 Maintains sharp conflict with the sons of Troy To whom Menxc5x93tius gallant son replied Hero! Eurypylus! how shall we act In this perplexity? what course pursue? I seek the brave Achilles to whose ear1020 I bear a message from the ancient chief Gerenian Nestor guardian of the Greeks Yet will I not even for such a cause My friend! abandon thee in thy distress He ended and his arms folding around1025 The warrior bore him thence into his tent His servant on his entrance spread the floor With hides on which Patroclus at his length Extended him and with his knife cut forth The rankling point; with tepid lotion next1030 He cleansed the gore and with a bitter root Bruised small between his palms sprinkled the wound At once the anodyne his pain assuaged The wound was dried within and the blood ceased It will be well here to observe the position of the Greeks All human aid is cut off by the wounds of their heroes and all assistance from the Gods forbidden by Jupiter On the contrary the Trojans see their general at their head and Jupiter himself fights on their side Upon this hinge turns the whole poem The distress of the Greeks occasions first the assistance of Patroclus and then the death of that hero brings back Achilles The poet shows great skill in conducting these incidents He gives Achilles the pleasure of seeing that the Greeks could not carry on the war without his assistance and upon this depends the great catastrophe of the poem BOOK XII ARGUMENT OF THE TWELFTH BOOK The Trojans assail the ramparts and Hector forces the gates BOOK XII So was Menxc5x93tius gallant son employd Healing Eurypylus The Greeks meantime And Trojans with tumultuous fury fought Nor was the foss ordaind long time to exclude The host of Troy nor yet the rampart built5 Beside it for protection of the fleet; For hecatomb the Greeks had offerd none Nor prayer to heaven that it might keep secure Their ships with all their spoils The mighty work As in defiance of the Immortal Powers10 Had risen and could not therefore long endure While Hector lived and while Achilles held His wrathful purpose; while the city yet Of royal Priam was unsackd so long The massy structure stood; but when the best15 And bravest of the Trojan host were slain And of the Grecian heroes some had fallen And some survived when Priams towers had blazed In the tenth year and to their native shores The Grecians with their ships at length returnd20 Then Neptune with Apollo leagued devised Its ruin; every river that descends From the Idxc3xa6an heights into the sea They brought against it gathering all their force Rhesus Caresus Rhodius the wide-branchd25 Heptaporus xc3x86sepus Granicus Scamanders sacred current and thy stream Simxc3xb6is whose banks with helmets and with shields Were strewd and Chiefs of origin divine; All these with refluent course Apollo drove30 Nine days against the rampart and Jove raind Incessant that the Grecian wall wave-whelmd Through all its length might sudden disappear Neptune with his tridental mace himself Led them and beam and buttress to the flood35 Consigning laid by the laborious Greeks Swept the foundation and the level bank Of the swift-rolling Hellespont restored The structure thus effaced the spacious beach He spread with sand as at the first; then bade40 Subside the streams and in their channels wind With limpid course and pleasant as before Apollo thus and Neptune from the first Designd its fall; but now the battle raved And clamors of the warriors all around45 The strong-built turrets whose assaulted planks Rang while the Grecians by the scourge of Jove Subdued stood close within their fleet immured At Hectors phalanx-scattering force appalld He as before with whirlwind fury fought50 As when the boar or lion fiery-eyed Turns short the hunters and the hounds among The close-embattled troop him firm oppose And ply him fast with spears; he no dismay Conceives or terror in his noble heart55 But by his courage falls; frequent he turns Attempting bold the ranks and where he points Direct his onset there the ranks retire; So through the concourse on his rolling wheels Borne rapid Hector animated loud60 His fellow-warriors to surpass the trench But not his own swift-footed steeds would dare That hazard; standing on the dangerous brink They neighd aloud for by its breadth the foss Deterrd them; neither was the effort slight65 To leap that gulf nor easy the attempt To pass it through; steep were the banks profound On both sides and with massy piles acute Thick-planted interdicting all assault No courser to the rapid chariot braced70 Had enterd there with ease; yet strong desires Possessd the infantry of that emprize And thus Polydamas the ear addressd Of dauntless Hector standing at his side Hector and ye the leaders of our host75 Both Trojans and allies!

down he fell And in the dust lay panting as an ox Among the mountains pants by peasants held695 In twisted bands and draggd perforce along; So panted dying Adamas but soon Ceased for Meriones approaching pluckd The weapon forth and darkness veild his eyes Helenus with his heavy Thracian blade700 Smiting the temples of Deipyrus Dashd off his helmet; from his brows remote It fell and wandering rolld till at his feet Some warrior found it and secured; meantime The sightless shades of death him wrappd around705 Grief at that spectacle the bosom filld Of valiant Menelaus; high he shook His radiant spear and threatening him advanced On royal Helenus who ready stood With his bow bent They met; impatient one710 To give his pointed lance its rapid course And one to start his arrow from the nerve The arrow of the son of Priam struck Atrides hollow corselet but the reed Glanced wide As vetches or as swarthy beans715 Leap from the van and fly athwart the floor By sharp winds driven and by the winnowers force So from the corselet of the glorious Greek Wide-wandering flew the bitter shaft away But Menelaus the left-hand transpierced720 Of Helenus and with the lances point Fastend it to his bow; shunning a stroke More fatal Helenus into his band Retired his arm dependent at his side And trailing as he went the ashen beam;725 There bold Agenor from his hand the lance Drew forth then folded it with softest wool Around sling-wool and borrowd from the sling Which his attendant into battle bore Then sprang Pisander on the glorious Chief730 The son of Atreus but his evil fate Beckond him to his death in conflict fierce Oh Menelaus mighty Chief! with thee And now they met small interval between Atrides hurld his weapon and it errd735 Pisander with his spear struck full the shield Of glorious Menelaus but his force Resisted by the stubborn buckler broad Faild to transpierce it and the weapon fell Snappd at the neck Yet when he struck the heart740 Rebounded of Pisander full of hope But Menelaus drawing his bright blade Sprang on him while Pisander from behind His buckler drew a brazen battle-axe By its long haft of polishd olive-wood745 And both Chiefs struck together He the crest That crownd the shaggy casque of Atreus son Hewd from its base but Menelaus him In his swift onset smote full on the front Above his nose; sounded the shatterd bone750 And his eyes both fell bloody at his feet Convolved with pain he lay; then on his breast Atrides setting fast his heel tore off His armor and exulting thus began So shall ye leave at length the Grecian fleet755 Traitors and never satisfied with war!

Chase it from thy mind afar Thinkst thou the Thunderer as intent to serve315 The Trojans and as jealous in their cause As erst for Hercules his genuine son? Come then and I will bless thee with a bride; One of the younger Graces shall be thine Pasithea day by day still thy desire320 She spake; Sleep heard delighted and replied By the inviolable Stygian flood Swear to me; lay thy right hand on the glebe All-teeming lay thy other on the face Of the flat sea that all the Immortal Powers325 Who compass Saturn in the nether realms May witness that thou givest me for a bride The younger Grace whom thou hast named divine Pasithea day by day still my desire He said nor beauteous Juno not complied330 But sware by name invoking all the powers Titanian calld who in the lowest gulf Dwell under Tartarus omitting none Her oath with solemn ceremonial sworn Together forth they went; Lemnos they left335 And Imbrus city of Thrace and in dark clouds Mantled with gliding ease swam through the air To Idas mount with rilling waters veind Parent of savage beasts; at Lectos7 first They quitted Ocean overpassing high340 The dry land while beneath their feet the woods Their spiry summits waved There unperceived By Jove Sleep mounted Idas loftiest pine Of growth that pierced the sky and hidden sat Secure by its expanded boughs the bird345 Shrill-voiced resembling in the mountains seen8 Chalcis in heaven on earth Cymindis named But Juno swift to Gargarus the top Of Ida soard and there Jove saw his spouse Saw her and in his breast the same love felt350 Rekindled vehement which had of old Joind them when by their parents unperceived They stole aside and snatchd their first embrace Soon he accosted her and thus inquired Juno! what region seeking hast thou left355 The Olympian summit and hast here arrived With neither steed nor chariot in thy train? To whom majestic Juno thus replied Dissembling To the green earths end I go To visit there the parent of the Gods360 Oceanus and Tethys his espoused Mother of all They kindly from the hands Of Rhea took and with parental care Sustaind and cherishd me;9 to them I haste Their feuds innumerable to compose365 Who disunited by intestine strife Long time from conjugal embrace abstain My steeds that lightly over dank and dry Shall bear me at the rooted base I left Of Ida river-veind But for thy sake370 From the Olympian summit I arrive Lest journeying remote to the abode Of Ocean and with no consent of thine Entreated first I should perchance offend To whom the cloud-assembler God replied375 Juno! thy journey thither may be made Hereafter Let us turn to dalliance now For never Goddess pourd nor woman yet So full a tide of love into my breast; I never loved Ixions consort thus380 Who bore Pirithoxc3xbcs wise as we in heaven; Nor sweet Acrisian Danxc3xa4e from whom Sprang Perseus noblest of the race of man; Nor Phxc5x93nix daughter fair10 of whom were born Minos unmatchd but by the powers above385 And Rhadamanthus; nor yet Semele Nor yet Alcmena who in Thebes produced The valiant Hercules; and though my son By Semele were Bacchus joy of man; Nor Ceres golden-haird nor high-enthroned390 Latona in the skies no nor thyself As now I love thee and my soul perceive Oerwhelmd with sweetness of intense desire Then thus majestic Juno her reply Framed artful Oh unreasonable haste!395 What speaks the Thunderer? If on Idas heights Where all is open and to view exposed Thou wilt that we embrace what must betide Should any of the everlasting Gods Observe us and declare it to the rest?400 Never could I arising seek again Thy mansion so unseemly were the deed But if thy inclinations that way tend Thou hast a chamber; it is Vulcans work Our sons; he framed and fitted to its posts405 The solid portal; thither let us his And there repose since such thy pleasure seems To whom the cloud-assembler Deity Fear thou not Juno lest the eye of man Or of a God discern us; at my word410 A golden cloud shall fold us so around That not the Sun himself shall through that veil Discover aught though keenest-eyed of all So spake the son of Saturn and his spouse Fast lockd within his arms Beneath them earth415 With sudden herbage teemd; at once upsprang The crocus soft the lotus bathed in dew And the crisp hyacinth with clustering bells; Thick was their growth and high above the ground Upbore them On that flowery couch they lay420 Invested with a golden cloud that shed Bright dew-drops all around11 His heart at ease There lay the Sire of all by Sleep and Love Vanquishd on lofty Gargarus his spouse Constraining still with amorous embrace425 Then gentle Sleep to the Achaian camp Sped swift away with tidings for the ear Of earth-encircler Neptune charged; him soon He found and in wingd accents thus began Now Neptune yield the Greeks effectual aid430 And while the moment lasts of Joves repose Make victory theirs; for him in slumbers soft I have involved while Juno by deceit Prevailing lured him with the bait of love He said and swift departed to his task435 Among the nations; but his tidings urged Neptune with still more ardor to assist The Danaxc3xaf; he leapd into the van Afar and thus exhorted them aloud Oh Argives! yield we yet again the day440 To Priameian Hector? Shall he seize Our ships and make the glory all his own? Such is his expectation so he vaunts For that Achilles leaves not yet his camp Resentful; but of him small need I judge445 Should here be felt could once the rest be roused To mutual aid Act then as I advise The best and broadest bucklers of the host And brightest helmets put we on and armd With longest spears advance; myself will lead;450 And trust me furious though he be the son Of Priam flies Ye then who feel your hearts Undaunted but are armd with smaller shields Them give to those who fear and in exchange Their stronger shields and broader take yourselves455 So he whom unreluctant all obeyd Then wounded as they were themselves the Kings Tydides Agamemnon and Ulysses Marshalld the warriors and from rank to rank Made just exchange of arms giving the best460 To the best warriors to the worse the worst And now in brazen armor all arrayd Refulgent on they moved by Neptune led With firm hand grasping his long-bladed sword Keen as Joves bolt; with him may none contend465 In dreadful fight; but fear chains every arm Opposite Priameian Hector ranged His Trojans; then they stretchd the bloody cord Of conflict tight Neptune cxc5x93rulean-haird And Hector pride of Ilium; one the Greeks470 Supporting firm and one the powers of Troy; A sea-flood dashd the galleys and the hosts Joind clamorous Not so the billows roar The shores among when Boreas roughest blast Sweeps landward from the main the towering surge;475 Not so devouring fire among the trees That clothe the mountain when the sheeted flames Ascending wrap the forest in a blaze; Nor howl the winds through leafy boughs of oaks Upgrown aloft (though loudest there they rave)480 With sounds so awful as were heard of Greeks And Trojans shouting when the clash began At Ajax first (for face to face they stood) Illustrious Hector threw a spear well-aimd But smote him where the belts that bore his shield485 And falchion crossd each other on his breast The double guard preserved him unannoyd Indignant that his spear had bootless flown Yet fearing death at hand the Trojan Chief Toward the phalanx of his friends retired490 But as he went huge Ajax with a stone Of those which proppd the ships (for numerous such Lay rolling at the feet of those who fought) Assaild him Twirling like a top it passd The shield of Hector near the neck his breast495 Struck full then ploughd circuitous the dust As when Joves arm omnipotent an oak Prostrates uprooted on the plain a fume Rises sulphureous from the riven trunk And if perchance some traveller nigh at hand500 See it he trembles at the bolt of Jove So fell the might of Hector to the earth Smitten at once Down droppd his idle spear And with his helmet and his shield himself Also; loud thunderd all his gorgeous arms505 Swift flew the Grecians shouting to the skies And showering darts to drag his body thence But neither spear of theirs nor shaft could harm The fallen leader with such instant aid His princely friends encircled him around510 Sarpedon Lycian Chief Glaucus the brave Polydamas xc3x86neas and renownd Agenor; neither tardy were the rest But with round shields all shelterd Hector fallen Him soon uplifted from the plain his friends515 Bore thence till where his fiery coursers stood And splendid chariot in the rear they came Then Troy-ward drove him groaning as he went Ere long arriving at the pleasant stream Of eddied Xanthus progeny of Jove520 They laid him on the bank and on his face Pourd water; he reviving upward gazed And seated on his hams black blood disgorged Coagulate but soon relapsing fell Supine his eyes with pitchy darkness veild525 And all his powers still torpid by the blow Then seeing Hector borne away the Greeks Rushd fiercer on all mindful of the fight And far before the rest Ajax the swift The Oxc3xaflean Chief with pointed spear530 On Satnius springing pierced him Him a nymph A Naiad bore to Enops while his herd Feeding on Satnios grassy verge he strayd But Oxc3xafliades the spear-renownd Approaching pierced his flank; supine he fell535 And fiery contest for the dead arose In vengeance of his fall spear-shaking Chief The son of Panthus into fight advanced Polydamas who Prothxc3xb6enor pierced Offspring of Arexc3xaflocus and urged540 Through his right shoulder sheer the stormy lance He prostrate clenchd the dust and with loud voice Polydamas exulted at his fall Yon spear methinks hurld from the warlike hand Of Panthus noble son flew not in vain545 But some Greek hath it purposing I judge To lean on it in his descent to hell So he whose vaunt the Greeks indignant heard But most indignant Ajax offspring bold Of Telamon to whom he nearest fell550 He quick at the retiring conqueror cast His radiant spear;

So Nestor prayd and Jove thunderd aloud465 Responsive to the old Nelexc3xafans prayer But when that voice of xc3x86gis-bearing Jove The Trojans heard more furious on the Greeks They sprang all mindful of the fight As when A turgid billow of some spacious sea470 While the wind blow that heaves its highest borne Sheer oer the vessels side rolls into her With such loud roar the Trojans passd the wall; In rushd the steeds and at the ships they waged Fierce battle hand to hand from chariots these475 With spears of double edge those from the decks Of many a sable bark with naval poles Long ponderous shod with steel; for every ship Had such for conflict maritime prepared While yet the battle raged only without480 The wall and from the ships apart so long Patroclus quiet in the tent and calm Sat of Eurypylus his generous friend Consoling with sweet converse and his wound Sprinkling with drugs assuasive of his pains485 But soon as through the broken rampart borne He saw the Trojans and the clamor heard And tumult of the flying Greeks a voice Of loud lament uttering with open palms His thighs he smote and sorrowful exclaimd490 Eurypylus! although thy need be great No longer may I now sit at thy side Such contest hath arisen; thy servants voice Must soothe thee now for I will to the tent Haste of Achilles and exhort him forth;495 Who knows? if such the pleasure of the Gods I may prevail; friends rarely plead in vain So saying he went Meantime the Greeks endured The Trojan onset firm yet from the ships Repulsed them not though fewer than themselves500 Nor could the host of Troy breaking the ranks Of Greece mix either with the camp or fleet; But as the line divides the plank aright Stretchd by some naval architect whose hand Minerva hath accomplishd in his art505 So stretchd on them the cord of battle lay Others at other ships the conflict waged But Hector to the ship advanced direct Of glorious Ajax; for one ship they strove; Nor Hector him dislodging thence could fire510 The fleet nor Ajax from the fleet repulse Hector conducted thither by the Gods Then noble Ajax with a spear the breast Pierced of Caletor son of Clytius armd With fire to burn his bark; sounding he fell515 And from his loosend grasp down droppd the brand But Hector seeing his own kinsman fallen Beneath the sable bark with mighty voice Calld on the hosts of Lycia and of Troy Trojans and Lycians and close-fighting sons520 Of Dardanus within this narrow pass Stand firm retreat not but redeem the son Of Clytius lest the Grecians of his arms Despoil him slain in battle at the ships So saying at Ajax his bright spear he cast525 Him pierced he not but Lycophron the son Of Mastor a Cytherian who had left Cytheras fugitive for blood and dwelt With Ajax Him standing at Ajax side He pierced above his ear; down from the stern530 Supine he fell and in the dust expired Then shuddering Ajax to his brother spake Alas my Teucer! we have lost our friend; Mastorides is slain whom we received An inmate from Cytherxc3xa6 and with love535 And reverence even filia entertaind; B9 Hector pierced he dies Where are thy shafts Death-wingd and bow by gift from Phxc5x93bus thine? He said whom Teucer hearing instant ran With bow and well-stored quiver to his side540 Whence soon his arrows sought the Trojan host He struck Pisenors son Clytus the friend And charioteer of brave Polydamas Offspring of Panthus toiling with both hands To rule his fiery steeds; for more to please545 The Trojans and their Chief where stormy most He saw the battle thither he had driven But sudden mischief valiant as he was Found him and such as none could waft aside For right into his neck the arrow plunged550 And down he fell; his startled coursers shook Their trappings and the empty chariot rang That sound alarmd Polydamas; he turnd And flying to their heads consignd them oer To Protiaxc3xb6ns son Astynoxc3xbcs555 Whom he enjoind to keep them in his view; Then turning mingled with the van again But Teucer still another shaft produced Designd for valiant Hector whose exploits (Had that shaft reachd him) at the ships of Greece560 Had ceased for ever But the eye of Jove Guardian of Hectors life slept not; he took From Telamonian Te5cer that renown And while he stood straining the twisted nerve Against the Trojan snappd it Devious flew565 The steel-charged11 arrow and he droppd his bow Then shuddering to his brother thus he spake Ah! it is evident Some Power divine Makes fruitless all our efforts who hath struck My bow out of my hand and snapt the cord570 With which I strung it new at dawn of day That it might bear the bound of many a shaft To whom the towering son of Telamon Leave then thy bow and let thine arrows rest Which envious of the Greeks some God confounds575 That thou mayst fight with spear and buckler armd And animate the rest Such be our deeds That should they conquer us our foes may find Our ships at least a prize not lightly won So Ajax spake; then Teucer in his tent580 The bow replacing slung his fourfold shield Settled on his illustrious brows his casque With hair high-crested waving as he moved Terrible from above took forth a spear Tough-graind acuminated sharp with brass585 And stood incontinent at Ajax side Hector perceived the change and of the cause Conscious with echoing voice calld to his host Trojans and Lycians and close-fighting sons Of Dardanus oh now my friends be men;590 Now wheresoever through the fleet dispersed Call into mind the fury of your might! For I have seen myself Jove rendering vain The arrows of their mightiest Man may know With ease the hand of interposing Jove595 Both whom to glory he ordains and whom He weakens and aids not; so now he leaves The Grecians but propitious smiles on us Therefore stand fast and whosoever galld By arrow or by spear dies let him die;600 It shall not shame him that he died to serve His country12 but his children wife and home With all his heritage shall be secure Drive but the Grecians from the shores of Troy So saying he animated each Meantime605 Ajax his fellow-warriors thus addressd Shame on you all! Now Grecians either die Or save at once your galley and yourselves Hope ye that should your ships become the prize Of warlike Hector ye shall yet return610 On foot? Or hear ye not the Chief aloud Summoning all his host and publishing His own hearts wish to burn your fleet with fire? Not to a dance believe me but to fight He calls them; therefore wiser course for us615 Is none than that we mingle hands with hands In contest obstinate and force with force Better at once to perish or at once To rescue life than to consume the time Hour after hour in lingering conflict vain620 Here at the ships with an inferior foe He said and by his words into all hearts Fresh confidence infused Then Hector smote Schedius a Chief of the Phocensian powers And son of Perimedes; Ajax slew625 Meantime a Chief of Trojan infantry Laodamas Antenors noble son While by Polydamas a leader bold Of the Epeans and Phylides13 friend Cyllenian Otus died Meges that sight630 Viewing indignant on the conqueror sprang But starting wide Polydamas escaped Saved by Apollo and his spear transpierced The breast of Crxc3xa6smus; on his sounding shield Prostrate he fell and Meges strippd his arms635 Him so employd Dolops assaild brave son Of Lampus best of men and bold in fight Offspring of King Laomedon; he stood Full near and through his middle buckler struck The son of Phyleus but his corselet thick640 With plates of scaly brass his life secured That corselet Phyleus on a time brought home From Ephyre where the Sellexc3xafs winds And it was given him for his lifes defence In furious battle by the King of men645 Euphetes Many a time had it preserved Unharmd the sire and now it saved the son Then Meges rising with his pointed lance The bushy crest of Dolops helmet drove Sheer from its base; new-tinged with purple bright650 Entire it fell and mingled with the dust While thus they strove each hoping victory Came martial Menelaus to the aid Of Meges; spear in hand apart he stood By Dolops unperceived through his back drove655 And through his breast the spear and far beyond And down fell Dolops forehead to the ground At once both flew to strip his radiant arms Then Hector summoning his kindred calld Each to his aid and Melanippus first660 Illustrious Hicetaons son reproved Ere yet the enemies of Troy arrived He in Percote fed his wandering beeves; But when the Danaxc3xaf with all their fleet Came thither then returning he outshone665 The noblest Trojans and at Priams side Dwelling was honord by him as a son Him Hector reprimanding stern began Are we thus slack? Can Melanippus view Unmoved a kinsman slain? Seest not the Greeks670 How busy there with Dolops and his arms? Come on It is no time for distant war But either our Achaian foes must bleed Or Ilium taken from her topmost height Must stoop and all her citizens be slain675 So saying he went whose steps the godlike Chief Attended; and the Telamonian next Huge Ajax animated thus the Greeks Oh friends be men!

That even Hector may himself be taught If my companion have a valiant heart295 When he goes forth alone or only then The noble frenzy feels that Mars inspires When I rush also to the glorious field But when he shall have driven the battle-shout Once from the fleet grant him with all his arms300 None lost himself unhurt and my whole band Of dauntless warriors with him safe return! Such prayer Achilles offerd and his suit Jove hearing part confirmd and part refused; To chase the dreadful battle from the fleet305 He gave him but vouchsafed him no return Prayer and libation thus performd to Jove The Sire of all Achilles to his tent Returnd replaced the goblet in his chest And anxious still that conflict to behold310 Between the hosts stood forth before his tent Then rushd the bands by brave Patroclus led Full on the Trojan host As wasps forsake Their home by the way-side provoked by boys Disturbing inconsiderate their abode315 Not without nuisance sore to all who pass For if thenceforth some traveller unaware Annoy them issuing one and all they swarm Around him fearless in their broods defence So issued from their fleet the Myrmidons320 Undaunted; clamor infinite arose And thus Patroclus loud his host addressd Oh Myrmidons attendants in the field On Peleus son now be ye men my friends!

loud shouted all The joyful Grecians and the navy rang Then soon as Iliums host the valiant son335 Saw of Menxc5x93tius and his charioteer In dazzling armor clad all courage lost Their closest ranks gave way believing sure That wrath renounced and terms of friendship chosen Achilles self was there; thus thinking each340 Lookd every way for refuge from his fate Patroclus first where thickest throng he saw Gatherd tumultuous around the bark Of brave Protesilaxc3xbcs hurld direct At the whole multitude his glittering spear345 He smote Pyrxc3xa6chmes; he his horsemen band Pxc5x93onian led from Amydon and from Broad-flowing Axius In his shoulder stood The spear and with loud groans supine he fell At once fled all his followers on all sides350 With consternation filld seeing their Chief And their best warrior by Patroclus slain Forth from the fleet he drove them quenchd the flames And rescued half the ship Then scatterd fled With infinite uproar the host of Troy355 While from between their ships the Danaxc3xaf Pourd after them and hideous rout ensued As when the king of lightnings Jove dispels From some huge eminence a gloomy cloud The groves the mountain-tops the headland heights360 Shine all illumined from the boundless heaven So when the Danaxc3xaf those hostile fires Had from their fleet expelld awhile they breathed Yet found short respite for the battle yet Ceased not nor fled the Trojans in all parts365 Alike but still resisted from the ships Retiring through necessity alone Then in that scatterd warfare every Chief Slew one While Arexc3xaflochus his back Turnd on Patroclus sudden with a lance370 His thigh he pierced and urged the weapon through Shivering the bone; he headlong smote the ground The hero Menelaus where he saw The breast of Thoas by his slanting shield Unguarded struck and stretchd him at his feet375 Phylides9 meeting with preventive spear The furious onset of Amphiclus gashd His leg below the knee where brawny most The muscles swell in man; disparted wide The tendons shrank and darkness veild his eyes380 The two Nestoridxc3xa6 slew each a Chief Of these Antilochus Atymnius pierced Right through his flank and at his feet he fell With fierce resentment fired Maris beheld His brothers fall and guarding spear in hand385 The slain impetuous on the conqueror flew; But godlike Thrasymedes10 wounded first Maris ere he Antilochus; he pierced His upper arm and with the lances point Rent off and stript the muscles to the bone390 Sounding he fell and darkness veild his eyes They thus two brothers by two brothers slain Went down to Erebus associates both Of brave Sarpedon and spear-practised sons Of Amisodarus; of him who fed395 Chimxc3xa6ra11 monster by whom many died Ajax the swift on Cleobulus sprang Whom while he toild entangled in the crowd He seized alive but smote him where he stood With his huge-hafted sword full on the neck;400 The blood warmd all his blade and ruthless fate Benighted dark the dying warriors eyes Peneleus into close contention rushd And Lycon Each had hurld his glittering spear But each in vain and now with swords they met405 He smote Peneleus on the crested casque But snappd his falchion; him Peneleus smote Beneath his ear; the whole blade entering sank Into his neck and Lycon with his head Depending by the skin alone expired410 Meriones oertaking Acamas Ere yet he could ascend his chariot thrust A lance into his shoulder; down he fell In dreary deaths eternal darkness whelmd Idomeneus his ruthless spear enforced415 Into the mouth of Erymas The point Stayd not but gliding close beneath the brain Transpierced his spine12 and started forth beyond It wrenchd his teeth and filld his eyes with blood; Blood also blowing through his open mouth420 And nostrils to the realms of death he passd Thus slew these Grecian leaders each a foe Sudden as hungry wolves the kids purloin Or lambs which haply some unheeding swain Hath left to roam at large the mountains wild;425 They seeing snatch them from beside the dams And rend incontinent the feeble prey So swift the Danaxc3xaf the host assaild Of Ilium; they into tumultuous flight Together driven all hope all courage lost430 Huge Ajax ceaseless sought his spear to cast At Hector brazen-maild who not untaught The warriors art with bull-hide buckler stood Sheltering his ample shoulders while he markd The hiss of flying shafts and crash of spears435 Full sure he saw the shifting course of war Now turnd but scorning flight bent all his thoughts To rescue yet the remnant of his friends As when the Thunderer spreads a sable storm Oer ether late serene the cloud that wrappd440 Olympus head escapes into the skies So fled the Trojans from the fleet of Greece Clamoring in their flight nor passd the trench In fair array; the coursers fleet indeed Of Hector him bore safe with all his arms445 Right through but in the foss entangled foul He left his host and struggling to escape Then many a chariot-whirling steed the pole Broken at its extremity forsook His driver while Patroclus with the shout450 Of battle calling his Achaians on Destruction purposed to the powers of Troy They once dispersed with clamor and with flight Filld all the ways the dust beneath the clouds Hung like a tempest and the steeds firm-hoofd455 Whirld off at stretch the chariots to the town He wheresoeer most troubled he perceived The routed host loud-threatening thither drove While under his own axle many a Chief Fell prone and the oertumbled chariots rang460 Right oer the hollow foss the coursers leapd Immortal by the Gods to Peleus given Impatient for the plain nor less desire Felt he who drove to smite the Trojan Chief But him his fiery steeds caught swift away465 As when a tempest from autumnal skies Floats all the fields what time Jove heaviest pours Impetuous rain token of wrath divine Against perverters of the laws by force Who drive forth justice reckless of the Gods;470 The rivers and the torrents where they dwell Sweep many a green declivity away And plunge at length groaning into the Deep From the hills headlong leaving where they passd No traces of the pleasant works of man475 So in their flight loud groand the steeds of Troy And now their foremost intercepted all Patroclus back again toward the fleet Drove them precipitate nor the ascent Permitted them to Troy for which they strove480 But in the midway space between the ships The river and the lofty Trojan wall Pursued them ardent slaughtering whom he reached And vengeance took for many a Grecian slain First then with glittering spear the breast he pierced485 Of Pronxc3xb6us undefended by his shield And stretchd him dead; loud rang his batterd arms The son of Enops Thestor next he smote He on his chariot-seat magnificent Low-cowering sat a fear-distracted form490 And from his palsied grasp the reins had fallen Then came Patroclus nigh and through his cheek His teeth transpiercing drew him by his lance Sheer oer the chariot front As when a man On some projecting rock seated with line495 And splendid hook draws forth a sea-fish huge So him wide-gaping from his seat he drew At his spear-point then shook him to the ground Prone on his face where gasping he expired At Eryalus next advancing swift500 He hurld a rock; full on the middle front He smote him and within the ponderous casque His whole head opend into equal halves With deadliest night surrounded prone he fell Epaltes Erymas Amphoterus505 Echius Tlepolemus Damastors son Evippus Ipheus Pyres Polymelus All these he on the champain corse on corse Promiscuous flung Sarpedon when he saw Such havoc made of his uncinctured13 friends510 By Menxc5x93tiades with sharp rebuke His band of godlike Lycians loud addressd Shame on you Lycians! whither would ye fly? Now are ye swift indeed! I will oppose Myself this conqueror that I may learn515 Who thus afflicts the Trojan host of life Bereaving numerous of their warriors bold He said and with his arms leapd to the ground On the other side Patroclus at that sight Sprang from his chariot As two vultures clash520 Bow-beakd crook-talond on some lofty rock Clamoring both so they together rushd With clamors loud; whom when the son observed Of wily Saturn with compassion moved His sister and his spouse he thus bespake525 Alas he falls! my most beloved of men Sarpedon vanquished by Patroclus falls!

That I may make my purpose known This day Birth-pang-dispensing Ilithya brings An hero forth to light who sprung from those That sprang from me his empire shall extend120 Over all kingdoms bordering on his own To whom designing fraud Juno replied Thou wilt be found false and this word of thine Shall want performance But Olympian Jove! Swear now the inviolable oath that he125 Who shall this day fall from between the feet Of woman drawing his descent from thee Shall rule all kingdoms bordering on his own She said and Jove suspecting nought her wiles The great oath swore to his own grief and wrong130 At once from the Olympian summit flew Juno and to Achaian Argos borne There sought the noble wife7 of Sthenelus Offspring of Perseus Pregnant with a son Six months she now the seventh saw at hand135 But him the Goddess premature produced And checkd Alcmenas pangs already due Then joyful to have so prevaild she bore Herself the tidings to Saturnian Jove Lord of the candent lightnings! Sire of all!140 I bring thee tidings The great prince ordaind To rule the Argive race this day is born Eurystheus son of Sthenelus the son Of Perseus; therefore he derives from thee Nor shall the throne of Argos shame his birth145 She spake; then anguish stung the heart of Jove Deeply and seizing by her glossy locks The Goddess Ate in his wrath he swore That never to the starry skies again And the Olympian heights he would permit150 The universal mischief to return Then whirling her around he cast her down To earth She mingling with all works of men Caused many a pang to Jove who saw his son Laborious tasks servile and of his birth155 Unworthy at Eurystheus will enjoind So when the hero Hector at our ships Slew us I then regretted my offence Which Ate first impelld me to commit But since infatuated by the Gods160 I errd behold me ready to appease With gifts of price immense whom I have wrongd Thou then arise to battle and the host Rouse also Not a promise yesternight Was made thee by Ulysses in thy tent165 On my behalf but shall be well performd Or if it please thee though impatient wait Short season and my train shall bring the gifts Even now; that thou mayst understand and know That my peace-offerings are indeed sincere170 To whom Achilles swiftest of the swift Atrides!

And last who under Earth the guilt avenge Of oaths sworn falsely let the Furies hear! For no respect of amorous desire Or other purpose have I laid mine hand315 On fair Brisxc3xabis but within my tent Untouchd immaculate she hath remaind And if I falsely swear then may the Gods The many woes with which they mark the crime Of men forsworn pour also down on me!320 So saying he pierced the victim in his throat And whirling him around Talthybius next Cast him into the ocean fishes food8 Then in the centre of Achaias sons Uprose Achilles and thus spake again325 Jove!

From him retire hereafter or expect A premature descent into the shades But when Achilles shall have once fulfilld410 His destiny in battle slain then fight Fearless for thou canst fall by none beside So saying he left the well-admonishd Chief And from Achilles eyes scatterd the gloom Shed oer them by himself The hero saw415 Clearly and with his noble heart incensed By disappointment thus conferring said Gods!

So spake he scorchd and all his waters boild As some huge caldron hisses urged by force425 Of circling fires and filld with melted lard The unctuous fluid overbubbling8 streams On all sides while the dry wood flames beneath So Xanthus bubbled and his pleasant flood Hissd in the fire nor could he longer flow430 But checkd his current with hot steams annoyd By Vulcan raised His supplication then Importunate to Juno thus he turnd Ah Juno! why assails thy son my streams Hostile to me alone? Of all who aid435 The Trojans I am surely least to blame Yet even I desist if thou command; And let thy son cease also; for I swear That never will I from the Trojans turn Their evil day not even when the host440 Of Greece shall set all Ilium in a blaze He said and by his oath pacified thus The white-armd Deity to Vulcan spake Peace glorious son! we may not in behalf Of mortal man thus longer vex a God445 Then Vulcan his tremendous fires repressd And down into his gulfy channel rushd The refluent flood; for when the force was once Subdued of Xanthus Juno interposed Although incensed herself to quell the strife450 But contest vehement the other Gods Now waged each breathing discord; loud they rushd And fierce to battle while the boundless earth Quaked under them and all around the heavens Sang them together with a trumpets voice455 Jove listening on the Olympian summit sat Well-pleased and in his heart laughing for joy Beheld the Powers of heaven in battle joind Not long aloof they stood Shield-piercer Mars His brazen spear graspd and began the fight460 Rushing on Pallas whom he thus reproachd Wasp! front of impudence and past all bounds Audacious! Why impellest thou the Gods To fight? Thy own proud spirit is the cause Rememberst not how urged by thee the son465 Of Tydeus Diomede myself assaild When thou the radiant spear with thy own hand Guiding didst rend my body? Now I ween The hour is come in which I shall exact Vengeance for all thy malice shown to me470 So saying her shield he smote tasselld around Terrific proof against the bolts of Jove; That shield gore-tainted Mars with fury smote But she retiring with strong grasp upheaved A rugged stone black ponderous from the plain475 A land-mark fixt by men of ancient times Which hurling at the neck of stormy Mars She smote him Down he fell Seven acres stretchd He overspread his ringlets in the dust Polluted lay and dreadful rang his arms480 The Goddess laughd and thus in accents wingd With exultation as he lay exclaimd Fool! Art thou still to learn how far my force Surpasses thine and darest thou cope with me? Now feel the furies of thy mothers ire485 Who hates thee for thy treachery to the Greeks And for thy succor given to faithless Troy She said and turnd from Mars her glorious eyes But him deep-groaning and his torpid powers Recovering slow Venus conducted thence490 Daughter of Jove whom soon as Juno markd In accents wingd to Pallas thus she spake Daughter invincible of glorious Jove! Haste follow her Ah shameless! how she leads Gore-tainted Mars through all the host of heaven495 So she whom Pallas with delight obeyd; To Venus swift she flew and on the breast With such force smote her that of sense bereft The fainting Goddess fell There Venus lay And Mars extended on the fruitful glebe500 And Pallas thus in accents wingd exclaimd I would that all who on the part of Troy Oppose in fight Achaias valiant sons Were firm and bold as Venus in defence Of Mars for whom she dared my power defy!505 So had dissension (Ilium overthrown And desolated) ceased long since in heaven So Pallas and approving Juno smiled Then the imperial Shaker of the shores Thus to Apollo Phxc5x93bus! wherefore stand510 _We_ thus aloof?

took over the barren deep To Samos Imbrus or to Lemnos girt With rocks inhospitable him he sold; But thee by his dread spear of life deprived He draggd and draggd around Patroclus tomb950 As if to raise again his friend to life Whom thou hadst vanquishd; yet he raised him not But as for thee thou liest here with dew Besprinkled fresh as a young plant18 and more Resemblest some fair youth by gentle shafts955 Of Phxc5x93bus pierced than one in battle slain So spake the Queen exciting in all hearts Sorrow immeasurable after whom Thus Helen third her lamentation pourd 19Ah dearer far than

the illustrious Hector found20 I cannot take my leave of this noble poem without expressing how much I am struck with this plain conclusion of it It is like the exit of a great man out of company whom he has entertained magnificently; neither pompous nor familiar; not contemptuous yet without much ceremony I recollect nothing among the works of mere man that exemplifies so strongly the true style of great antiquity Tr FOOTNOTES Footnotes for Book I Latonas son and Joves was Apollo the tutelary deity of the Dorians The Dorians had not however at this early age become the predominant race in Greece proper They had spread along the eastern shores of the Archipelago into the islands especially Crete and had every where signalized themselves by the Temples of Apollo of which there seems to have been many in and about Troy These temples were schools of art and prove the Dorians to have been both intellectual and powerful Homer was an Ionian and therefore not deeply acquainted with the nature of the Dorian god But to a mind like his the god of a people so cultivated and associated with what was most grand in art must have been an imposing being and we find him so represented Throughout the Iliad he appears and acts with splendor and effect but always against the Greeks from mere partiality to Hector It would perhaps be too much to say that in this partiality to Hector we detect the spirit of the Dorian worship the only Paganism of antiquity that tended to perfect the individual Apollo being the expression of the moral harmony of the universe and the great spirit of the Dorian culture being to make a perfect man an incarnation of the xcexbaxcexbfxcfx83xcexbcxcexbfxcfx82 This Homer could only have known intuitively In making Apollo author of the plague he was confounded with Helios which was frequent afterwards but is not seen elsewhere in Homer The arrows of Apollo were silent as light and their emblem the suns rays The analogies are multitudinous between the natural and intellectual sun; but Helios and Apollo were two EPP There is something exceedingly venerable in this appearance of the priest He comes with the ensigns of the gods to whom he belongs with the laurel wreath to show that he was a suppliant and a golden sceptre which the ancients gave in particular to Apollo as they did one of silver to Diana The art of this speech is remarkable Chryses considers the army of Greeks as made up of troops partly from the kingdoms and partly from democracies and therefore begins with a distinction that includes all Then as priest of Apollo he prays that they may obtain the two blessings they most desire the conquest of Troy and a safe return As he names his petition he offers an extraordinary ransom and concludes with bidding them fear the god if they refuse it; like one who from his office seems to foretell their misery and exhorts them to shun it Thus he endeavors to work by the art of a general application by religion by interest and the insinuation of danger Homer is frequently eloquent in his silence Chryses says not a word in answer to the insults of Agamemnon but walks pensively along the shore The melancholy flowing of the verse admirably expresses the condition of the mournful and deserted father So called on account of his having saved the people of Troas from a plague of mice _sminthos_ in their language meaning a mouse Tr Apollo had temples at Chrysa Tenedos and Cilla all of which lay round the bay of Troas Mxc3xbcller remarks that the temple actually stood in the situation referred to and that the appellation of Smintheus was still preserved in the district Thus far actual circumstances are embodied in the mythus On the other hand the action of the deity as such is purely ideal and can have no other foundation than the belief that Apollo sternly resents ill usage of his priests and that too in the way here represented viz by sending plagues This belief is in perfect harmony with the idea generally entertained of the power and agency of Apollo; and it is manifest that the idea placed in combination with certain events gave birth to the story so far as relates to the god We have not yet the means of ascertaining whether it is to be regarded as a historical tradition or an invention and must therefore leave that question for the present undecided The poet is careful to leave no prayer unanswered that has justice on its side He who prays either kills his enemy or has signs given him that he has been heard For this singular line the Translator begs to apologize by pleading the strong desire he felt to produce an English line if possible somewhat resembling in its effect the famous original one xcex94xcexb5xcexb9xcexbdxcexb7 xcexb4xcexb5 xcexbaxcexbbxcexb1xcexb3xcexb3xcexb7 xcexb3xcexb5xcexbdxcexb5xcfx84 xcexb1xcfx81xcexb3xcfx85xcfx81xcexb5xcexbfxcexb9xcexbf xcexb2xcexb9xcexbfxcexb9xcexbf Tr The plague in the Grecian camp was occasioned perhaps by immoderate heats and gross exhalations Homer takes occasion from it to open the scene with a beautiful allegory He supposes that such afflictions are sent from Heaven for the punishment of evil actions; and because the sun was the principal agent he says it was sent to punish Agamemnon for despising that god and injuring his priest Hippocrates observes two things of plagues; that their cause is in the air and that different animals are differently affected by them according to their nature and nourishment This philosophy is referred to the plagues here mentioned First the cause is in the air by means of the darts or beams of Apollo; second the mules and dogs are said to die sooner than the men partly from their natural quickness of smell and partly from their feeding so near the earth whence the exhalations arise Juno queen of Olympus sides with the Grecians Mr Coleridge (in his disquisition upon the Prometheus of xc3x86schylus published in his Remains) shows very clearly by historical criticism that Juno in the Grecian religion expressed the spirit of conservatism Without going over his argument we assume it here for Homer always attributes to Juno every thing that may be predicated of this principle She is persistent obstinate acts from no idea but often uses a superficial reasoning and refers to Fate with which she upbraids Jupiter Jupiter is the intellectual power or Free Will and by their union or rather from their antagonism the course of things proceeds with perpetual vicissitude but with a great deal of life EPP Observe this Grecian priest He has no political power and commands little reverence In Agamemnons treatment of him as well as Chryses is seen the relation of the religion to the government It was neither master nor slave EPP A district of Thessaly forming a part of the larger district of Phthiotis Phthiotis according to Strabo included all the southern portion of that country as far as Mount xc5x92ta and the Maliac Gulf To the west it bordered on Dolopia and on the east reached the confines of Magnesia Homer comprised within this extent of territory the districts of Phthia and Hellas properly so called and generally speaking the dominions of Achilles together with those of Protesilaus and Eurypylus xcex9axcfx85xcexbdxcfx89xcfx80xcexb1 xcexbcxcexb5xcexb3xcexb1xcexbdxcexb1xcexb9xcexb4xcexb5xcfx82 Agamemnons anger is that of a lover and Achilles that of a warrior Agamemnon speaks of Chrysxc3xabis as a beauty whom he values too much to resign Achilles treats Brisxc3xabis as a slave whom he is anxious to preserve in point of honor and as a testimony of his glory Hence he mentions her only as his spoil the reward of war etc; accordingly he relinquishes her not in grief for a favorite whom he loses but in sullenness for the injury done him Dacier Jupiter in the disguise of an ant deceived Eurymedusa the daughter of Cleitos Her son was for this reason called Myrmidon (from xcexbcxcfx85xcfx81xcexbcxcexb7xcexbe an ant) and was regarded as the ancestor of the Myrmidons in Thessaly Smith According to the belief of the ancients the gods were supposed to have a peculiar light in their eyes That Homer was not ignorant of this opinion appears from his use of it in other places Minerva is the goddess of the art of war rather than of war itself And this fable of her descent is an allegory of Achilles restraining his wrath through his consideration of martial law and order This law in that age prescribed that a subordinate should not draw his sword upon the commander of all but allowed a liberty of speech which appears to us moderns rather out of order EPP The shield of Jupiter made by Vulcan and so called from its covering which was the skin of the goat that suckled him Tr Homer magnifies the ambush as the boldest enterprise of war They went upon those parties with a few only and generally the most daring of the army and on occasions of the greatest hazard when the exposure was greater than in a regular battle Idomeneus in the 13th book tells Meriones that the greatest courage appears in this way of service each man being in a manner singled out to the proof of it In the earlier ages of the world the sceptre of a king was nothing more than his walking-staff and thence had the name of sceptre Ovid in speaking of Jupiter describes him as resting on his sceptre Spence From the description here given it would appear to have been a young tree cut from the root and stripped of its branches It was the custom of Kings to swear by their sceptres For an account of the contest between the Centaurs and Lapiths here referred to see Grecian and Roman Mythology In _antiquity_ a sacrifice of a hundred oxen or beasts of the same kind; hence sometimes _indefinitely_ any sacrifice of a large number of victims The original is here abrupt and expresses the precipitancy of the speaker by a most beautiful aposiopesis Tr The Iliad in its connection is we all know a glorification of Achilles by Zeus; for the Trojans only prevail because Zeus wishes to show that the reposing hero who sits in solitude can alone conquer them But to leave him this glorification entirely unmixed with sorrow the Grecian sense of moderation forbids The deepest anguish must mingle with his consciousness of fame and punish his insolence That glorification is the will of Zeus; and in the spirit of the ancient mythus a motive for it is assigned in a divine legend The sea-goddess Thetis who was according to the Phthiotic mythus wedded to the mortal Peleus saved Zeus by calling up the giant Briareus or xc3x86gxc3xa6on to his rescue Why it was xc3x86gxc3xa6on is explained by the fact that this was a great sea-demon who formed the subject of fables at Poseidonian Corinth where even the sea-god himself was called xc3x86gxc3xa6on; who moreover was worshipped at several places in Eubxc5x93a the seat of Poseidon xc3x86gxc3xa6us; and whom the Theogony calls the son-in-law of Poseidon and most of the genealogists especially Eumelus in the Titanomachy brought into relation with the sea There is therefore good reason to be found in ancient belief why Thetis called up xc3x86gxc3xa6on of all others to Joves assistance The whole of the story however is not detailed it is not much more than indicated and therefore it would be difficult even now to interpret it in a perfectly satisfactory manner It bears the same relation to the Iliad that the northern fables of the gods which serve as a back-ground to the legend of Nibelungen bear to our German ballad only that here the separation is much greater still Muller Homer makes use of this fable without reference to its meaning as an allegory Briareus seems to symbolize a navy and the fable refers to some event in remote history when the reigning power was threatened in his autocracy and strengthened by means of his association with the people against some intermediate class EPP xcexb5xcfx80xcexb1xcfx85xcfx81xcfx89xcexbdxcfx84xcexb1xcexb9 A name by which we are frequently to understand the Nile in Homer Tr Around the sources of the Nile and thence south-west into the very heart of Africa stretching away indefinitely over its mountain plains lies the country which the ancients called Ethiopia rumors of whose wonderful people found their way early into Greece and are scattered over the pages of her poets and historians Homer wrote at least eight hundred years before Christ and his poems are well ascertained to be a most faithful mirror of the manners of his times and the knowledge of his age * * * * * * Homer never wastes an epithet He often alludes to the Ethiopians elsewhere and always in terms of admiration and praise as being the most just of men and the favorites of the gods The same allusions glimmer through the Greek mythology and appear in the verses of almost all the Greek poets ere yet the countries of Italy and Sicily were even discovered The Jewish Scriptures and Jewish literature abound in allusions to this distant and mysterious people the annals of the Egyptian priests are full of them and uniformly the Ethiopians are there lauded as among the best the most religious and most civilized of men Christian Examiner The Ethiopians says Diodorus are said to be the inventors of pomps sacrifices solemn meetings and other honors paid to the gods From hence arose their character of piety which is here celebrated by Homer Among these there was an annual feast at Diospolis which Eustathius mentions when they carried about the statues of Jupiter and other gods for twelve days according to their number; to which if we add the ancient custom of setting meat before statues it will appear to be a rite from which this fable might easily have arisen The original word (xcfx80xcexbfxcexbbxcfx85xcexb2xcexb5xcexbdxcexb8xcexb5xcexbfxcfx82) seems to express variety of soundings an idea probably not to be conveyed in an English epithet Tr The following passage gives the most exact account of the ancient sacrifices that we have left us There is first the purification by the washing of hands; second the offering up of prayers; third the barley-cakes thrown upon the victim; fourth the manner of killing it with the head turned upwards; fifth selecting the thighs and fat for their gods as the best of the sacrifice and disposing about them pieces cut from every part for a representation of the whole (hence the thighs are frequently spoken of in Homer and the Greek poets as the whole victim); sixth the libation of wine; seventh consuming the thighs in the fire of the altar; eighth the sacrificers dressing and feasting on the rest with joy and hymns to the gods The _Pxc3xa6an_ (originally sung in honor of Apollo) was a hymn to propitiate the god and also a song of thanksgiving when freed from danger It was always of a joyous nature Both tune and sound expressed hope and confidence It was sung by several persons one of whom probably led the others and the singers either marched onward or sat together at table It was the custom to draw the ships entirely upon the shore and to secure them by long props Felton Suppliants threw themselves at the feet of the person to whom the supplication was addressed and embraced his knees Felton Ambrosia the food of the gods conferred upon them eternal youth and immortality and was brought to Jupiter by pigeons It was also used by the gods for anointing the body and hair Hence the expression ambrosial locks The original says the ox-eyed goddess which furnishes Coleridge with one of the hints on which he proceeds in historically identifying the Argive Juno with Io and Isis &c There is real wit in Homers making her say to Jupiter I never search thy thoughts &c The principle of conservatism asks nothing of the intellectual power but blindly contends reposing upon the instinct of a common sense which leads her always to surmise that something is intended by the intellectual power that she shall not like EPP This refers to an old fable of Jupiters hanging up Juno and whipping her Homer introduces it without reference to its meaning which was undoubtedly some physical truth connected with the ether and the atmosphere EPP The reader in order that he may partake with the gods in the drollery of this scene should observe that the crippled and distorted Vulcan had thrust himself into an office at all other times administered either by Hebe or Ganymede Tr As Minerva or Wisdom was among the company the poets making Vulcan act the part of peace-maker would appear to have been from choice knowing that a mirthful person may often stop a quarrel by making himself the subject of merriment Footnotes for Book II The poem now becomes more exciting; the language more animated; the descriptions more lively and figurative Homer seems to kindle with his subject and to press all the phenomena of nature into his service for the purpose of illustration and adornment Jupiter prepares to keep his promise of avenging Achilles by drawing Agamemnon into a deceitful expectation of taking the city The forces are arranged for battle which gives occasion for the celebrated catalogue Felton The whole action of the Dream is natural It takes the figure of one much beloved by Agamemnon as the object that is most in our thoughts when awake is the one that oftenest appears to us in our dreams and just at the instant of its vanishing leaves so strong an impression that the voice seems still sounding in his ear The Dream also repeats the words of Jupiter without variation which is considered as a great propriety in delivering a message from the father of gods and men King of Pylus an ancient city of Elis Agamemnon seems to entertain some doubts lest the army should so resent his treatment of their favorite Achilles as to be indisposed to serve him Tr Mercury Argus Homer in a happy and poetical manner acquaints us with the high descent of Agamemnon and traces the origin of his power to the highest source by saying that the sceptre had descended to him from the hand of Jupiter The power of Agamemnon as a monarch refers to his being the leader of an army According to the form of royalty in the heroic age a king had only the power of a magistrate except as he held the office of priest Aristotle defines a king as a Leader of war a Judge of controversies and President of the ceremonies of the gods That he had the principal care of religious rites appears from many passages in Homer His power was nowhere absolute but in war for we find Agamemnon insulted in the council but in the army threatening deserters with death Agamemnon is sometimes styled king of kings as the other princes had given him supreme authority over them in the siege The extremest provocation is implied in this expression which Thersites quotes exactly as he had heard it from the lips of Achilles Tr The character of Thersites is admirably sketched There is nothing vague and indistinct but all the traits are so lively that he stands before us like the image of some absurd being whom we have ourselves seen It has been justly remarked by critics that the poet displays great skill in representing the opponents of Agamemnon in the character of so base a personage since nothing could more effectually reconcile the Greeks to the continuance of the war than the ridiculous turbulence of Thersites Felton Some for xcfx80xcexbfxcexbdxcexbfxcfx82 here read xcfx80xcexbfxcexb8xcexbfxcfx82; which reading I have adopted for the sake both of perspicuity and connection Tr The principal signs by which the gods were thought to declare their will were things connected with the offering of sacrifices the flight and voice of birds all kinds of natural phenomena ordinary as well as extraordinary dreams An epithet supposed to have been derived from Gerenia a Messenian town where Nestor was educated In the pictures which Homer draws of him the most striking features are his wisdom bravery and knowledge of war his eloquence and his old age For some general remarks upon the heroes of the time see Grecian and Roman Mythology In allusion to the custom of pouring out a libation of pure wine in the ceremony of forming a league and joining right hands as a pledge of mutual fidelity after the sacrifice Felton Nestor is supposed here to glance at Achilles Tr Homer here exalts wisdom over valor Money stamped with the figure of an ox Tr The encouragement of a divine power seemed all that was requisite to change the dispositions of the Grecians and make them more ardent for combat than they had previously been to return This conquers their inclinations in a manner at once poetical and in keeping with the moral which is every where spread through Homer that nothing is accomplished without divine assistance Homers rich invention gives us five beautiful similes on the march of the army This profusion and variety can never be sufficiently admired The superior knowledge that the poet here attributes to the Muses as divine beings and then his occasional invocations to them gives an air of importance to his subject and has an imposing effect However fabulous the other parts of Homers poems may be this account of the princes people and countries is by far the most valuable piece of history and geography left us in regard to the state of Greece in that early period Greece was then divided into several dynasties which Homer has enumerated under their respective princes; and his division was considered so correct that many disputes respecting the boundaries of Grecian cities were decided upon his authority Eustathius has collected together the following instances The city of Calydon was adjudged to the xc3x86tolians notwithstanding the pretensions of xc3x86olia because it was ranked by Homer as belonging to the former Sestos was given to those of Abydos upon the plea that he had said the Abydonians were possessors of Sestos Abydos and Arisbe When the Milesians and people of Priene disputed their claim to Mycale a verse of Homer gave it to the Milesians The Athenians were put in possession of Salamis by another which was cited by Solon or (according to some) interpolated by him for that purpose; and Porphyry says that the catalogue was so highly esteemed that the youths of some nations were required to commit it to memory Professor Felton remarks The student is advised to give particular attention to this important passage He will find it the most interesting fragment of geography extant; interesting for the poetical beauty of the verse the regular order which is followed and the little characteristic touches which denote the peculiarities of the several provinces The more he examines this catalogue with the subsidiary lights of geography history and travels the more cause will he find of wonder that a description so ancient should combine so much accuracy beauty and interest It is recommended to the student to trace the provinces and cities on some good map of ancient Greece Some say Thebes the less others the suburbs of Thebes the greater It is certain that Thebes itself sent none Tr It was the custom of these people to shave the fore parts of their heads that their enemies might not seize them by the hair; on the hinder part they allowed it to grow as a valiant race that would never turn their backs Their manner of fighting was hand to hand without quitting their javelins Menelaus is occasionally distinguished by his activity which shows his personal concern in the war The Arcadians being an inland people were unskilled in navigation for which reason Agamemnon furnished them with shipping Nireus is nowhere mentioned as a leader but in these lines As rank and beauty were his only qualifications he is allowed to sink into oblivion The mud of the Peneus is of a light color for which reason Homer gives it the epithet of silvery The Titaresius and other small streams which are rolled from Olympus and Ossa are so extremely clear that their waters are distinguished from those of the Peneus for a considerable distance from the point of their confluence Dodwell Dr Clarke in his travels describes this tomb as a conical mound; and says that it is the spot of all others for viewing the plain of Troy as it is visible in all parts of Troas From its top may be traced the course of the Scamander the whole chain of Ida stretching towards Lectum the snowy heights of Gargarus and all the shores of Hellespont near the mouth of the river Sigxc3xa6um and the other tumuli upon the coast A patronymic given to Achilles as descendant of xc3x86acus father of Peleus A river of Troas in Asia Minor the same as the Scamander This expression is construed by critics as denoting an unpolished dialect but not a foreign Footnotes for Book III The scenes described in this book are exceedingly lifesome The figures are animating and beautiful and the mind of the reader is borne along with breathless interest over the sonorous verse Felton This is a striking simile from its exactness in two points the noise and the order It has been supposed that the embattling of an army was first learned by observing the close order of the flight of these birds The noise of the Trojans contrasts strongly with the silence of the Greeks Plutarch remarks upon this distinction as a credit to the military discipline of the latter and Homer would seem to have attached some importance to it as he again alludes to the same thing Book iv 510 Paris frequently named Alexander in the original Tr Not from cowardice but from a sense of guilt towards Menelaus At the head of an army he challenges the boldest of the enemy; and Hector at the end of the Sixth Book confesses that no man could reproach him as a coward Homer has a fine moral; A brave mind however blinded with passion is sensible of remorse whenever he meets the person whom he has injured; and Paris is never made to appear cowardly but when overcome by the consciousness of his injustice xcex9bxcexb1xcexb9xcexbdxcexbfxcexbd xcexb5xcfx83xcfx83xcexbf xcfx87xcexb9xcfx84xcfx89xcexbdxcexb1 In allusion to the Oriental custom of stoning to death for the crime of adultery Felton The sling was a very efficacious and important instrument in ancient warfare Stones were also thrown with the hand The Libyans carried no other arms than the spear and a bag of stones The Trojans were required to sacrifice two lambs; one male of a white color to the Sun as the father of light and one female and black to the Earth the mother and nurse of men That these were the powers to which they sacrificed appears from their being attested by name in the oath III 330 Helens weaving the events of the Trojan war in a veil is an agreeable fiction; and one might suppose that it was inherited by Homer and explained in his Iliad Dacier Not the grasshopper but an insect well known in hot countries and which in Italy is called Cicxc3xa1la The grasshopper rests on the ground but the favorite abode of the Cicxc3xa1la is in the trees and hedges Tr This episode is remarkable for its beauty The effect of Helens appearance upon the aged counsellors is striking and poetical It must be borne in mind that Helen was of divine parentage and unfading beauty and this will explain the enthusiasm which her sight called forth from the old men The poets skill in taking this method of describing the Grecian chieftains is obvious and the sketches themselves are living and characteristic to a high degree The reminiscences of the aged Priam as their names are announced and the penitential sorrow of the erring Helen which the sight of her countrymen and the recollection of her home her child her companions excite in her bosom are among the most skilful touches of natural feeling Felton The character of a benevolent old man is well preserved in Priams behavior to Helen Upon observing her confusion he attributes the misfortunes of the war to the gods alone This sentiment is also natural to old age Those who have had the longest experience of life are the most inclined to ascribe the disposal of all things to the will of Heaven This view of the Grecian leaders from the walls of Troy is admired as an episode of great beauty and considered a masterly manner of acquainting the reader with the figure and qualifications of each hero Helen sees no where in the plain her two brothers Castor and Pollux Her inquiry is a natural one and her self-reproach naturally suggests her own disgrace as the cause of their not appearing among the other commanders The two lines in which the poet mentions their death are simple and touching Felton Homer here gives the whole ceremonial of the solemn oath as it was then observed by the nations of whom he writes It must be borne in mind that sacrificing was the most solemn act of religion and that kings were also chief-priests The armor of both Greeks and Trojans consisted of six portions and was always put on in the order here given The greaves were for the defence of the legs They were made of some kind of metal and probably lined with cloth or felt The cuirass or corselet for the body was made of horn cut in thin pieces and fastened upon linen cloth one piece overlapping another The sword hung on the left side by means of a belt which passed over the right shoulder The large round shield sometimes made of osiers twisted together and covered with several ox-hides and bound round the edge with metal In the Homeric times it was supported by a belt; subsequently a band was placed across the inner side in which the left arm was inserted and a strong leather strap fastened near the edge at certain distances which was grasped by the hand The helmet made of metal and lined with felt Lastly the spear and in many cases two The heavy-armed soldiery were distinguished from the light The covering of the latter consisted of skins and instead of the sword and lance they fought with darts bows and arrows or slings and were generally attached in a subordinate capacity to the heavy-armed soldiery Homer puts a prayer in the mouth of Menelaxc3xbcs but none in that of Paris Menelaxc3xbcs is injured and innocent and may therefore ask for justice; but Paris who is the criminal remains silent Because the hide of a beast that dies in health is tougher and fitter for use than of another that dies diseased Footnotes for Book IV The goddess of youth is made an attendant at the banquets of the gods to show that they enjoyed a perpetual youth and endless felicity A town of that name in Bxc5x93otia where Pallas was particularly worshipped Tr xcex92xcexbfxcfx89xcfx80xcexb9xcfx82 constant description of Juno but not susceptible of literal translation Homer does not make the gods use all persons indiscriminately as their agents but each according to his powers When Minerva would persuade the Greeks she seeks Ulysses; when she would break the truce for Pandarus; and when she would conquer for Diomede The goddess went not to the Trojans because they hated Paris and looks among the allies where she finds Pandarus who was of a nation noted for perfidiousness and who from his avarice was capable of engaging in this treachery for the hope of a reward from Paris A city of Asia Minor This description so full of circumstantial detail is remarkably beautiful 1 The history of the bow giving in a few words the picture of a hunter lying in ambush and slaying his victim 2 Then the process of making the bow 3 The anxious preparation for discharging the arrow with certainty which was destined to break off the truce and precipitate the battle 4 The hurried prayer and vow to Apollo after which the string is drawn the cord twangs the arrow leaps forth The whole is described with such graphic truth that we see and hear and wait in breathless suspense to know the result Felton This is one of those humble comparisons with which Homer sometimes diversifies his subject but a very exact one of its kind and corresponding in all its parts The care of the goddess the unsuspecting security of Menelaus the ease with which she diverts the danger and the danger itself are all included in these few words To which may be added that if the providence of heavenly powers to their creatures is expressed by the love of a mother to her child if men in regard to them are but as sleeping infants and the dangers that seem so great to us as easily warded off as the simile implies the conception appears sublime however insignificant the image may at first seem in regard to a hero From this we learn that the Lydians and Carians were famous for their skill in dying purple and that their women excelled in works of ivory; and also that there were certain ornaments that only kings and princes were privileged to wear This speech of Agamemnon over his wounded brother is full of noble power and touching eloquence The Trojans have violated a truce sanctioned by a solemn sacrifice to the gods The reflection that such perjury cannot pass with impunity but that Jove will sooner or later punish it occurs first to the mind of the warrior In the excitement of the moment he predicts that the day will surely come when sacred Troy shall fall From this impetuous feeling his mind suddenly returns to the condition of his brother and imagines with much pathos the consequences that will follow from his death and ends with the wish that the earth may open before him when that time shall come Felton The poet here changes the narration and apostrophises the reader Critics commend this figure as the reader then becomes a spectator and his mind is kept fixed on the action In the following review of the army we see the skill of an accomplished general as well as the characters of the leaders whom Agamemnon addresses He begins with an address to the army in general and then turns to individuals To the brave he urges their secure hopes of conquest since the gods must punish perjury; to the timid their inevitable destruction if the enemy should burn their ships After this he flies from rank to rank skilfully addressing each ally and presents a lively picture of a great mind in the highest emotion The ancients usually in their feasts divided to the guests in equal portions except they took particular occasion to show distinction It was then considered the highest mark of honor to be allotted the best portion of meat and wine and to be allowed an exemption from the laws of the feast in drinking wine unmingled and without measure This custom was much more ancient than the time of the Trojan war and we find it practised in the banquet given by Joseph to his brethren Diverse interpretations are given of this passage I have adopted that which to me appeared most plausible It seems to be a caution against the mischiefs that might ensue should the horses be put under the management of a driver with whom they were unacquainted The scholium by Villoisson much countenances this solution Tr Here Nestor only mentions the name of Ereuthalion knowing the present to be an improper time for story-telling; in the seventh book he relates his fight and victory at length This passage may serve to confute those who charge Nestor with indiscriminate loquacity Tr The first Theban war previously alluded to took place twenty-seven years before the war of Troy Sthenelus here speaks of the second which happened ten years after the first For an account of these wars see Grecian and Roman Mythology This is a most animated description The onset the clashing of spears the shield pressed to shield the tumult of the battle the shouts and groans of the slayer and the dying all are described in words the very sound of which conveys the terrible meaning Then come the exploits performed by individual heroes The student must bear in mind that the battles of the heroic age depended in a great measure upon the prowess of single chieftains Hence the appropriateness of the following enumeration Felton So called from the river Simoxc3xafs near which he was born It was an eastern custom to name children from the most remarkable accident of their birth The Scriptures furnish many examples In the Old Testament princes were also compared to trees and Simxc3xb6isius is here resembled to a poplar Homer occasionally puts his readers in mind of Achilles and finds occasion to celebrate his valor with the highest praise Apollo here tells the Trojans they have nothing to fear since Achilles fights not xcex91xcexbaxcfx81xcexbfxcexbaxcexbfxcexbcxcexbfxcexb9 They wore only a lock of hair on the crown of the head Footnotes for Book V In each battle there is one prominent person who may be called the hero of the day This arrangement preserves unity and helps to fix the attention of the reader The gods sometimes favor one hero and sometimes another In this book we have the exploits of Diomede Assisted by Minerva he is eminent both for prudence and valor Sirius This comparison among many others shows how constantly the poets attention was directed to the phenomena of nature Felton xcex97xcexb9xcexbfxcexb5xcexbdxcfx84xcexb9 The chariots were probably very low We frequently find in the Iliad that a person standing in a chariot is killed (and sometimes by a stroke on the head) by a foot soldier with a sword This may farther appear from the ease with which they mount or alight to facilitate which the chariots were made open behind That the wheels were small may be supposed from their custom of taking them off and putting them on Hebe puts on the wheels of Junos chariot when he called for it in battle It may be in allusion to the same custom that it is said in Ex ch xiv The Lord took off their chariot wheels so that they drove them heavily That it was very small and light is evident from a passage in the tenth Il where Diomede debates whether he shall draw the chariot of Rhesus out of the way or carry it on his shoulders to a place of safety Meges son of Phyleus This whole passage is considered by critics as very beautiful It describes the hero carried by an enthusiastic valor into the midst of his enemies and mingling in the ranks indiscriminately The simile thoroughly illustrates this fury proceeding as it did from an extraordinary infusion of courage from Heaven Apollo The deities are often invoked because of the agency ascribed to them and not from any particular religious usage And just as often the heroes are protected by the gods who are worshipped by their own tribes and families Muller This fiction of Homer says Dacier is founded upon an important truth of religion not unknown to the Pagans viz that God only can open the eyes of men and enable them to see what they cannot otherwise discover The Old Testament furnishes examples God opens the eyes of Hagar that she may see the fountain The Lord opened the eyes of Baalam and he saw the angel etc This power of sight was given to Diomede only for the present occasion In the 6th Book on meeting Glaucus he is ignorant whether he is a god a hero or a man Or collar-bone The belief of those times in regard to the peace and happiness of the soul after death made the protection of the body a matter of great importance For a full account of these rites see the articles Charon and Pluto Gr & Rom Mythology The physician of the gods Homer says nothing of his origin He seems to be considered as distinct from Apollo though perhaps originally identical with him From the fact that so few mystical myths are introduced in the Iliad Mxc3xbcller infers that the mystical element of religion could not have predominated among the Grecian people for whom Homer sang Otherwise his poems in which that element is but little regarded would not have afforded universal pleasure and satisfaction He therefore takes but a passing notice of Demeter Mxc3xbcller also remarks that in this we cannot but admire the artistic skill of Homer and the feeling for what is right and fitting that was innate with the Greeks Vide Samson to Harapha in the Agonistes There the word is used in the same sense Tr This is a construction of xcexbbxcexb5xcfx85xcexba xcexb5xcexbbxcexb5xcfx86xcexb1xcexbdxcfx84xcexb9 given by some of the best commentators and that seems the most probable Tr This slow and orderly retreat of the Greeks with their front constantly turned to the enemy is a fine encomium on their courage and discipline This manner of retreating was customary among the Lacedxc3xa6monians as were many other martial customs described by Homer The practice arose from the apprehension of being killed by a wound in the back which was not only punished with infamy but a person bearing the mark was denied the rites of burial This according to Porphyrius as quoted by Clarke is the true meaning of xcexb1xcexb9xcexbfxcexbbxcexbfxcexbcxcexb9xcfx84xcfx81xcexb7xcfx82 Tr The chariots of the gods were formed of various metals and drawn through the air or upon the surface of the sea by horses of celestial breed These chariots were used by the deities only on occasion of a long journey or when they wished to appear with state and magnificence Ordinarily they were transported from place to place by the aid of their golden sandals with the exception of the silver-footed Thetis to whom they seem to have been superfluous When at home the gods were barefoot according to the custom of the age as we see from various representations of antique art These which I have called crescents were a kind of hook of a semicircular form to which the reins were occasionally fastened Tr The Greeks borrowed the vest and shield of Minerva from the Lybians only with this difference the Lybian shield was fringed with thongs of leather and the Grecian with serpents Herodotus This expression (the gates of Heaven) is in the eastern manner and common in the Scriptures xcex91xcfx81xcexb5xcexb1 xcfx84xcexbfxcexbdxcexb4xcexb5 Every thing that enters the dark empire of Hades disappears and is seen no more; hence the figurative expression to put on Plutos helmet; that is to become invisible Footnotes for Book VI The Simoxc3xafs and Xanthus were two rivers of the Troad which form a junction before they reached the Hellespont The Simoxc3xafs rose in Mt Ida and the Xanthus had its origin near Troy Felton Ajax commences his exploits immediately on the departure of the gods from the battle It is observed of this hero that he is never assisted by the deities Axylus was distinguished for his hospitality This trait was characteristic of the Oriental nations and is often alluded to by ancient writers The rite of hospitality often united families belonging to different and hostile nations and was even transmitted from father to son This description is a fine tribute to the generosity of Axylus Felton Euryalus Agamemnons taking the life of the Trojan whom Menelaus had pardoned was according to the custom of the times The historical books of the Old Testament abound in instances of the like cruelty to conquered enemies This important maxim of war is very naturally introduced upon Menelaus being ready to spare an enemy for the sake of a ransom According to Dacier it was for such lessons as these that Alexander so much esteemed Homer and studied his poem The custom of making donations to the gods is found among the ancients from the earliest times of which we have any record down to the introduction of Christianity; and even after that period it was observed by the Christians during the middle ages Its origin seems to have been the same as that of sacrifices viz the belief that the gods were susceptible of influence in their conduct towards men These gifts were sometimes very costly but often nothing more than locks of hair cut from the head of the votary Diomede had knowingly wounded and insulted the deities; he therefore met Glaucus with a superstitious fear that he might be some deity in human shape This feeling brought to his mind the story of Lycurgus It is said that Lycurgus caused most of the vines of his country to be rooted up so that his subjects were obliged to mix their wine with water as it became less plentiful Hence the fable that Thetis received Bacchus into her bosom This style of language was according to the manners of the times Thus Goliath to David Approach and I will give thy flesh to the fowls of the air and the beasts of the field The Orientals still speak in the same manner Though this comparison may be justly admired for its beauty in the obvious application to the mortality and succession of human life it seems designed by the poet in this place as a proper emblem of the transitory state of families which by their misfortune or folly have fallen and decayed and again appear in a happier season to revive and flourish in the fame and virtues of their posterity In this sense it is a direct answer to the question of Diomede as well as a proper preface to what Glaticus relates of his own family which having become extinct in Corinth recovers new life in Lycia The same as Corinth Some suppose that alphabetical writing was unknown in the Homeric age and consequently that these signs must have been hieroglyphical marks The question is a difficult one and the most distinguished scholars are divided in opinion We can hardly imagine that a poem of the length and general excellence of the Iliad could be composed without the aid of writing; and yet we are told there are well-authenticated examples of such works being preserved and handed down by traditional memory However this may be we know that the Oriental nations were in possession of the art of alphabetical writing it a very early period and before the Trojan war It cannot then seem very improbable that the authors of the Iliad should also have been acquainted with it Felton The Solymi were an ancient nation inhabiting the mountainous parts of Asia Minor between Lycia and Pisidia Pliny mentions them as having become extinct in his time It was the custom in ancient times upon the performance of any signal service by kings or great men for the public to grant them a tract of land as a reward When Sarpedon in the 12th Book exhorts Glaucus to behave valiantly he reminds him of these possessions granted by his countrymen The laws of hospitality were considered so sacred that a friendship contracted under their observance was preferred to the ties of consanguinity and alliance and regarded as obligatory even to the third and fourth generation Diomede and Glaucus here became friends on the ground of their grandfathers having been mutual guests The presents made on these occasions were preserved by families as it was considered obligatory to transmit them as memorials to their children xcex9excexb5xcexb9xcexbdxcexbfxcexb9 xcfx80xcexb1xcfx84xcfx81xcfx89xcexb9xcexbfxcexb9 The Scxc3xa6an gate opened to the field of battle and was the one through which the Trojans made their excursions Close to this stood the beech tree sacred to Jupiter and often mentioned in connection with it There is a mournfulness in the interview between the hero and his mother which is deeply interesting Her urging him to take wine and his refusal were natural and simple incidents which heighten the effect of the scene Felton The custom that prohibits persons polluted with blood from performing any offices of divine worship before purification is so ancient and universal that it may be considered a precept of natural religion tending to inspire a horror of bloodshed In Euripides Iphigenia argues the impossibility of human sacrifices being acceptable to the gods since they do not permit any one defiled with blood or even polluted with the touch of a dead body to come near their altars Paris surprised the King of Phxc5x93necia by night and carried off many of his treasures and captives among whom probably were these Sidonian women Tyre and Sidon were famous for works in gold embroidery etc and for whatever pertained to magnificence and luxury This gesture is the only one described by Homer as being used by the ancients in their invocations of the gods xcexb4xcexb9xcexb1 xcexb8xcexb5xcexb1xcfx89xcexbd The employment in which Hector finds Paris engaged is extremely characteristic Felton This address of Helen is in fine keeping with her character Felton The bulk of his heroes is a circumstance of which Homer frequently reminds us by the use of the word xcexbcxcexb5xcexb3xcexb1xcfx82 and which ought therefore by no means to be suppressed Tr Love of his country is a prominent characteristic of Hector and is here beautifully displayed in his discharging the duties that the public welfare required before seeking his wife and child Then finding that she had gone to the tower he retraces his steps to the Scxc3xa6an gate whence he must seek the field Here his wife on her return home accidentally meets him The name signifies the _Chief of the city_ Tr It was the custom to plant about tombs only such trees as elms alders etc that bear no fruit as being most appropriate to the dead In this recapitulation Homer acquaints us with some of the great achievements of Achilles which preceded the opening of the poem a happy manner of exalting his hero and exciting our expectation as to what he is yet to accomplish His greatest enemies never upbraid him but confess his glory When Apollo encourages the Trojans to fight it is by telling them Achilles fights no more When Juno animates the Greeks she reminds them how their enemies fear Achilles; and when Andromache trembles for Hector it is with the remembrance of his resistless force Drawing water was considered the most servile employment The Scholiast in Villoisson calls it xcfx86xcfx85xcfx83xcexb9xcexbaxcexbfxcexbd xcfx84xcexb9xcexbdxcexb1 xcexbaxcexb1xcexb9 xcexbcxcexb5xcfx84xcfx81xcexb9xcexbfxcexbd xcexb3xcexb5xcexbbxcfx89xcfx84xcexb1 a natural and moderate laughter Tr According to the ancient belief the fatal period of life is appointed to all men at the time of their birth which no precaution can avoid and no danger hasten This scene for true and unaffected pathos delicate touches of nature and a profound knowledge of the human heart has rarely been equalled and never surpassed among all the efforts of genius during the three thousand years that have gone by since it was conceived and composed Felton Footnotes for Book VII Holding the spear in this manner was in ancient warfare understood as a signal to discontinue the fight The challenge of Hector and the consternation of the Greeks presents much the same scene as the challenge of Goliath 1 Samuel ch 17 And he stood and cried to the armies of Israel; Choose you a man for you and let him come down to me If he be able to fight with me and to kill me then will we be your servants When Saul and all Israel heard the words of the Philistine they were dismayed and greatly afraid It was an ancient custom for warriors to dedicate trophies of this kind to the temples of their tutelary deities The club-bearer It is a word used by Dryden Homer refers every thing even the chance of the lots to the disposition of the gods Agamemnon The lot was merely a piece of wood or shell or any thing of the kind that was at hand Probably it had some private mark and not the name as it was only recognized by the owner This reply is supposed to allude to some gesture made by Ajax in approaching Hector The heralds were considered as sacred persons the delegates of Mercury and inviolable by the laws of nations Ancient history furnishes examples of the severity exercised upon those who were guilty of any outrage upon them Their office was to assist in the sacrifices and councils to proclaim war or peace to command silence at ceremonies or single combats to part the combatants and declare the conqueror This word I have taken leave to coin The Latins have both substantive and adjective _Purpura Purpureus_ We make purple serve both uses; but it seems a poverty to which we have no need to submit at least in poetry Tr A particular mark of honor and respect as this part of the victim belonged to the king In the simplicity of the times the reward offered a victorious warrior of the best portion of the sacrifice at supper a more capacious bowl or an upper seat at table was a recompense for the greatest actions It is worthy of observation that beef mutton or kid was the food of the heroes of Homer and the patriarchs and warriors of the Old Testament Fishing and fowling were then the arts of more luxurious nations The word is here used in the Latin sense of it Virgil describing the entertainment given by Evander to the Trojans says that he regaled them Perpetui _tergo bovis et lustralibus extis_ xc3x86n viii It means the whole Tr Footnotes for Book VIII An epithet of Aurora supposed to designate an early hour Many have explained this as an allegorical expression for one of the great laws of nature gravity or the attraction of the sun There is not the slightest probability that any such meaning is intended Felton A part of Mt Ida This place was celebrated in subsequent times for the worship of Jupiter Several years ago Dr ED Clarke deposited in the vestibule of the public library in Cambridge England a marble bust of Juno taken from the ruins of this temple of Jupiter at the base of Mt Ida Felton In the repetition of this expression the translator follows the original Sacred because that part of the day was appropriate to sacrifice and religious worship This figure is first used in the Scriptures Job prays to be weighed in an even balance that God may know his integrity Daniel says to Belshazzar thou art weighed in the balances and found wanting etc Jupiters declaring against the Greeks by thunder and lightning is drawn (says Dacier) from truth itself 1 Sam ch vii And as Samuel was offering up the burnt-offering the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel; but the Lord thundered on that day upon the Philistines and discomfited them Nothing can be more spirited than the enthusiasm of Hector who in the transport of his joy breaks out in the following apostrophe to his horses He has in imagination already forced the Grecian entrenchments set the fleet in flames and destroyed the whole army From this speech it may be gathered that women were accustomed to loosen the horses from the chariot on their return from battle and feed them; and from line 214 unless it is spurious it seems that the provender was sometimes mixed with wine It is most probable however that the line is not genuine Felton Homer describes a princess so tender in her love to her husband that she meets him on his return from every battle and in the joy of seeing him again feeds his horses with bread and wine as an acknowledgment to them for bringing him back Dacier These were the arms that Diomede had received from Glaucus None daring to keep the field and all striving to enter the gates together they obstructed their own passage and were of course compelled into the narrow interval between the foss and rampart But there are different opinions about the space intended See Villoisson Tr To Jove the source of all oracular information Jupiter in answer to the prayer of Agamemnon sends an omen to encourage the Greeks The application of it is obvious The eagle signified Hector the fawn denoted the fear and flight of the Greeks and being dropped at the altar of Jupiter indicated that they would be saved by the protection of that god This simile is very beautiful and exactly represents the manner of Gorgythions death There is so much truth in the comparison that we pity the fall of the youth and almost feel his wound xcex95xcexbdxcexb9xcexbaxcexbbxcexb1xcexbd The word is here metaphorical and expresses in its primary use the breaking of a spear against a shield Tr The following lines to the end of this paragraph are a translation of some which Barnes has here inserted from the second Alcibiades of Plato The simile is the most magnificent that can be conceived The stars come forth brightly the whole heaven is cloudless and serene the moon is in the sky the heights and promontories and forests stand forth distinctly in the light _and the shepherd rejoices in his heart_ This last simple and natural circumstance is inexpressibly beautiful and heightens the effect of the visible scene by associating it in the most direct and poetical manner with the inward emotion that such a scene must produce Felton Footnotes for Book IX In the original the word is xcexbcxcexb5xcexbbxcexb1xcexbdxcfx85xcexb4xcfx81xcexbfxcfx82 dark-watered; and it is rendered

affirm that courage is above crowns and sceptres In former times they were not hereditary but the recompense of valor The observation seems made with a view to prevent such a reply from Agamemnon to Diomede as might give birth to new dissensions while it reminds him indirectly of the mischiefs that had already attended his quarrel with Achilles Tr This speech of Nestor is happily conceived It belonged to him as the aged counsellor to begin the debate by laying the subject before the assembly especially as it was necessary to impale the blame of the present unfortunate condition of the army to Agamemnon It would have been presumptuous in any other and it was a matter of difficulty and delicacy even for Nestor Felton In the heroic age the bridegroom before marriage was obliged to make two presents one to his betrothed wife and one to his father-in-law This was also an ancient custom of the Hebrews Abrahams servant gave presents to Rebekah Gen xxiv 22 Shechem promised a dowry and gift to Jacob for his daughter Gen xxiv 12 And in after times Saul said he desired no dowry for Michal 1 Sam xviii 25 One of the religious ceremonies previous to any important enterprise Then followed the order for silence and reverent attention; then the libation &c Felton Achilles having retired from action in displeasure to Agamemnon quieted himself by singing to his lyre the achievements of demi-gods and heroes Nothing was better suited to the martial disposition of this hero than these heroic songs Celebrating the actions of the valiant prepared him for his own great exploits Such was the music of the ancients and to such purposes was it applied When the lyre of Paris was offered to Alexander he replied that he had little value for it but much desired that of Achilles on which he sung the actions of heroes in former times Plutarch The manners of the Iliad are the manners of the patriarchal and early ages of the East The chief differences arise from a different religion and a more maritime situation Very far removed from the savage state on the one hand and equally distant from the artificial state of an extended commerce and a manufacturing population on the other the spirit and habitudes of the two modes of society are almost identical The hero and the Patriarch are substantially coxc3xabval; but the first wanders in twilight the last stands in the eye of Heaven When three men appeared to Abraham in the plains of Mamre he ran to meet them from the tent door brought them in directed Sarah to make bread fetched from the herd himself a calf tender and good dressed it and set it before them When Ajax Ulysses and Phxc5x93nix stand before Achilles he rushes forth to greet them brings them into the tent directs Patroclus to mix the wine cuts up the meat dresses it and sets it before the ambassadors * * * * Instances of this sort might be multiplied to any extent but the student will find it a pleasing and useful task to discover them for himself; and these will amply suffice to demonstrate the existence of that correspondence of spirit and manners between the Homeric and the early ages of the Bible history to which I have adverted It is real and important; it affords a standard of the feelings with which we ought to read the Iliad if we mean to read it as it deserves; and it explains and sets in the true point of view numberless passages which the ignorance or frivolity of after-times has charged with obscurity meanness or error The Old Testament and the Iliad reflect light mutually on each other; and both in respect of poetry and morals (for the whole of Homers poetry is a praise of virtue and every thing in him tends to this point except that which is merely superfluous and for ornament) it may with great truth be said that he who has the longest studied and the most deeply imbibed the spirit of the Hebrew Bible will the best understand and the most lastingly appreciate the tale of Troy divine HN Coleridge I have given this sense to the word xcex96xcfx89xcfx81xcexbfxcfx84xcexb5xcfx81xcexbfxcexbd on the authority of the Venetian Scholium though some contend that it should be translated _quickly_ Achilles who had reproached Agamemnon with intemperate drinking was himself more addicted to music than to wine Tr It is not without authority that I have thus rendered xcexbaxcfx81xcexb5xcexb9xcexbfxcexbd xcexbcxcexb5xcexb3xcexb1 Homers banquets are never stewed or boiled; it cannot therefore signify a kettle It was probably a kitchen-table dresser or tray on which the meat was prepared for the spit Accordingly we find that this very meat was spitted afterward See Schaufelbergerus Tr There are no speeches in the Iliad better placed better timed or that give a greater idea of Homers genius than these of the ambassadors to Achilles They are not only demanded by the occasion but skilfully arranged and in a manner that gives pleasure to the reader Dacier observes that he pluralizes the one wife of Menelaus through the impetuosity of his spirit Tr According to some ancient writers Achilles was but twelve years of age when he went to the wars of Troy And from what is here related of his education under Phxc5x93nix it may be inferred that the fable of his having been taught by Chiron is an invention of a later age and unknown to Homer The ancients gave the name of Jupiter not only to the God of heaven but also to the God of hell as is seen here; and to the God of the sea as appears from xc3x86schylus They meant thereby to show that one sole deity governed the world To teach this truth statues were made of Jupiter which had three eyes Priam had one in the court of his palace which in sharing the booty of the war of Troy fell to the lot of Sthenelus who carried it to Greece Dacier So called because Jove protects those who implore his aid Wrinkled because the countenance of a man driven to prayer by a consciousness of guilt is sorrowful and dejected Lame because it is a remedy to which men recur late and with reluctance And slant-eyed either because in that state of humiliation they fear to lift their eyes to heaven or are employed in taking a retrospect of their past misconduct The whole allegory considering _when_ and _where_ it was composed forms a very striking passage Tr She had five brothers Iphiclus Polyphontes Phanes Eurypylus Plexippus Tr It was the custom for the murderer to go into banishment for one year But if the relations of the murdered person were willing the criminal by paying a certain fine might buy off the exile and remain at home Ajax sums up this argument with great strength We see says he a brother forgive the murder of his brother a father that of his son; but Achilles will not forgive the injury offered him by taking away one captive woman The character of Achilles is well sustained in all his speeches To Ulysses he returns a flat denial and threatens to leave the Trojan shore in the morning To Phxc5x93nix his answer is more gentle After Ajax has spoken he seems determined not to depart but yet refuses to bear arms except in defence of his own squadron Footnotes for Book X With slight alteration Homer here repeats the verses that open the 2d Book and ascribes to Agamemnon the same watchfulness over men that Jupiter had over the gods Menelaus starts a design which is afterwards proposed by Nestor in council The poet knew that the project would come with greater weight from the age of the one than from the youth of the other and that the valiant would be ready to engage in the enterprise suggested by so venerable a counsellor Agamemnon is uniformly represented as an example of brotherly affection and at all times defends Menelaus xcexa3xcexb1xcfx85xcfx81xcfx89xcfx84xcexb7xcfx81 seems to have been a hollow iron with a point fitted to the obtuse end of the spear for the purpose of planting that end of it in the ground It might probably be taken off at pleasure Tr The dogs represent the watch the flocks the Greeks the fold their camp and the wild beast that invades them Hector The place position and circumstances are represented with the utmost life and nature _Sable_ because the expedition was made by night and _each with a lamb_ as typical of the fruit of their labors Tr It required some address in Diomede to make a choice without offending the Grecian princes each one of whom might consider it an indignity to be refused such a place of honor Diomede therefore chose Ulysses not for his valor but for his wisdom On this point the other leaders all yielded to him The heroes are well armed for their design Ulysses has a bow and arrows that he may be able to wound the enemy at a distance and Diomede a two-edged sword They both have leathern helmets as the glittering of the metal might betray them to the enemy Autolycus was grandfather of Ulysses by the mothers side Tr Making these military presents to brave adventurers was an ancient custom Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him and gave it to David; and his garments even to his sword and his bow and his girdle 1 Sam xviii v These lines show how careful the poet always was to be true to nature The little circumstance that they could not _see_ the heron but only heard him stamps the description with an air of verisimilitude which is at once recognized Felton This passage sufficiently justifies Diomede for his choice of Ulysses Diomede who was most renowned for valor might have given a wrong interpretation to this omen and have been discouraged from proceeding in the attempt For though it really signified that as the bird was not seen but only heard so they should not be discovered by the Trojans but perform actions of which all Troy should hear with sorrow; yet on the other hand it might imply that as they discovered the bird by the noise of its wings so the noise they should make would betray them to the Trojans Pallas does not send the bird sacred to herself but the heron because that is a bird of prey and denoted that they should spoil the Trojans Dolon seems to have been eminent for wealth and Hector summons him to the assembly as one of the chiefs of Troy He was known to the Greeks perhaps from his having passed between the two armies as a herald Ancient writers observe that it was the office of Dolon that led him to offer himself in this service The sacredness attached to it gave him hopes that they would not violate his person should he chance to be taken; and his riches he knew were sufficient to purchase his liberty Besides these advantages he probably trusted to his swiftness to escape pursuit Eustathius remarks upon the different manner in which the Grecians and Trojans conduct the same enterprise In the council of the Greeks a wise old man proposes the adventure with an air of deference; in that of the Trojans a brave young man with an air of authority The one promises a small gift but honorable and certain; the other a great one but uncertain and less honorable because it is given as a reward Diomede and Ulysses are inspired with a love of glory; Dolon with the thirst of gain They proceed with caution and bravery; he with rashness and vanity They go in conjunction; he alone They cross the fields out of the road he follows the common track In all this there is an admirable contrast and a moral that strikes every reader at first sight Commentators are extremely in the dark and even Aristarchus seems to have attempted an explanation in vain The translator does not pretend to have ascertained the distance intended but only to have given a distance suited to the occasion Tr Ulysses makes no promise of life but artfully bids Dolon who is overpowered by fear not to think of death He was so cautious as not to believe a friend just before without an oath but he trusts an enemy without even a promise xcex9fxcfx83xcfx83xcexb1xcexb9 xcexb3xcexb1xcfx81 xcexa4xcfx81xcfx89xcfx89xcexbd xcfx80xcfx85xcfx81xcexbfxcfx82 xcexb5xcfx83xcfx87xcexb1xcfx81xcexb1xcexb9 As many as are owners of hearths that is to say all who are householders here or natives of the city Tr It seems barbarous in Diomede thus to have killed Dolon but Eustathius observes that it was necessary to their success as his cries might have put the Trojans on their guard An allegorical manner of saying that they were awakened by the morning light Homer did not here forget himself though some have altered xcfx84xcfx81xcexb9xcfx82 xcexb9xcexbf xcfx84xcexb5xcfx84xcfx81xcexb1xcexbaxcexb1xcexb9xcexb4xcexb5xcexbaxcexb1xcfx84xcexbfxcexbd Rhesus for

have seen I find it no where but in the _Venetian Scholium_ Tr It is finely remarked by Trollope that of all the points of resemblance which may be discovered between the sentiments associations and expressions of Homer and those of the sacred writings this similitude is perhaps the most striking; and there can be little doubt that it exhibits a traditional vestige of the patriarchal record of Gods covenant Felton Quxc3xa2tre-crested So I have rendered xcfx84xcexb5xcfx84xcfx81xcexb1xcfx86xcexb1xcexbbxcexb7xcfx81xcexbfxcexbd which literally signifies having four cones The cone was a tube

this interpretation of a passage to us not very intelligible The ancient manner of mowing and reaping was for the laborers to divide in two parties and to begin at each end of the field which was equally divided and proceed till they met in the middle of it Time was then measured by the progression of the sun and the parts of the day were distinguished by the various employments

xcex91xcexbdxcexb5xcexbcxcexbfxcfx84xcfx81xcexb5xcfx86xcexb5xcfx82 literally wind-nourished Tr In making Ulysses direct Diomede Homer intends to show that valor should be under the guidance of wisdom In the 8th Book when Diomede could hardly be restrained by the thunder of Jupiter his valor is checked by the wisdom of Nestor Diomede does not fear Hector but Jupiter who he has previously said will give the Trojans the day In the original xcexbaxcexb5xcfx81xcexb1 xcexb1xcexb3xcexbbxcexb1xcexb5 All that I pretend to know of this expression is that it is ironical and may relate either to the head-dress of Paris or to his archership To translate it is impossible; to paraphrase it in a passage of so much emotion would be absurd I have endeavored to supply its place by an appellation in point of contempt equal Tr No moral is so evident throughout the Iliad as the dependence of man upon divine assistance and protection Apollo saves Hector from the dart and Minerva Ulysses Homer here pays a marked distinction The army had seen several of their bravest heroes wounded yet without expressing as much concern as at the danger of Machaon their physician and surgeon This interpretation of xcexbcxcexb9xcexbdxcfx85xcexbdxcexb8xcexb1 xcexb4xcexb5 xcfx87xcexb1xcexb6xcexb5xcfx84xcexbf xcexb4xcexbfxcfx85xcfx81xcexbfxcfx82 is taken from the Scholium by Villoisson It differs from those of Clarke Eustathius and another Scholiast quoted by Clarke but seems to suit the context much better than either Tr The address of Homer in bringing off Ajax is admirable He makes Hector afraid to approach him and brings down Jupiter to terrify him Thus he retreats not from a mortal but from a God The whole passage is inimitably just and beautiful We see Ajax slowly retreating between two armies and even with a look repulse the one and protect the other Every line resembles Ajax The character of a stubborn and undaunted warrior is perfectly maintained He compares him first to the lion for his undaunted spirit in fighting and then to the ass for his stubborn slowness in retreating In the latter comparison there are many points of resemblance that enliven the image The havoc he makes in the field is represented by the tearing and trampling down the harvests; and we see the bulk strength and obstinancy of the hero when the Trojans in respect to him are compared to the troops of boys that impotently endeavor to drive him away It must be borne in mind that among the people of the East an ass was a beast upon which kings and princes might ride with dignity Though the resentment of Achilles would not permit him to be an actor in the field yet his love of war inclines him to be a spectator As the poet did not intend to draw the character of a perfect man in Achilles he makes him delighted with the destruction of the Greeks because it gratified his revenge That resentment which is the subject of the poem still presides over every other feeling even the love of his country He begins now to pity his countrymen yet he seems gratified by their distress because it will contribute to his glory This onion was very different from the root which now passes under that name It had a sweet flavor and was used to impart an agreeable flavor to wine It is in high repute at the present day in Egypt Felton I have interpreted the very ambiguous words xcexbfxcfx85xcfx89 xcexb4 xcfx85xcfx80xcexbf xcfx80xcfx85xcexb8xcexbcxcexb5xcexbdxcexb5xcfx82 xcexb7xcfx83xcexb1xcexbd according to Athenxc3xa6us as quoted by Clarke and his interpretation of them is confirmed by the Scholium in the Venetian edition of the Iliad lately published by Villoisson Tr Homer here reminds the reader that Nestor belonged to a former generation of men who were stronger than the heroes of the war It would have suited the dignity of Agamemnons rank to have mentioned _his_ wound first; but Nestor making this recital to the _friend of Achilles_ names him slightly and without any addition Tr It is said that the Thebans having war with the people of Orchomenos the Pylians assisted the latter for which cause Hercules destroyed their city See Scholium per Villoisson Tr Footnotes for Book XII The word is of scripture use; see Gen ch xxx where it describes the cattle of Jacob Tr Alluding to the message delivered to him from Jupiter by Iris Tr The morality of the Iliad deserves particular attention It is not _perfect_ upon Christian principles How should it be under the circumstances of the composition of the poem? Yet compared with that of all the rest of the classical poetry it is of a transcendently noble and generous character The answer of Hector to Polydamas who would have dissuaded a further prosecution of the Trojan success has been repeated by many of the most devoted patriots the world ever saw _We_ who defy augury in these matters can yet add nothing to the nobleness of the sentiment HN Coleridge xcfx80xcexbbxcexb5xcexbfxcexbdxcfx89xcexbd xcexb4xcexb5 xcfx84xcexbfxcexb9 xcexb5xcfx81xcexb3xcexbfxcexbd xcexb1xcexbcxcexb5xcexb9xcexbdxcexbfxcexbd This is evidently proverbial for which reason I have given it that air in the translation Tr There is something touching in this simile Our attention is fixed not so much on the battle as on the struggles of the laboring true-hearted woman who toils for a hard-earned pittance for her children The description is not so much illustrated by the simile as the simile by the description Felton The description of this exploit of Hector is wonderfully imposing It seems to be the poets wish to magnify his deeds during the short period that he has yet to live both to do justice to the hero of Troy and to give the greater glory to Achilles his conquerer Felton Footnotes for Book XIII We are hurried through this book by the warlike ardor of the poet Battle succeeds battle with animating rapidity The speeches are in fine keeping with the scenes and the similes are drawn from the most imposing natural phenomena The descriptions possess a wonderful distinctness and vigor presenting the images to the mind by a few bold and grand lines thus shunning the confusion of intricate and minute detail Felton So called from their simple diet consisting principally of mares milk They were a people living on the north-east coast of the Euxine Sea These epithets are sometimes supposed to be the _gentile_ denominations of the different tribes;

we involuntarily wish him success and deplore his misfortune though we admire the invincible courage of his more fortunate antagonist His actions and sentiments springing from the simplest feelings of our nature will always command applause and under all circumstances and every form of political existence will be imitated by the defenders of their country The speech of Ajax is animating and powerful It is conceived in the true spirit of a warrior rousing his followers to make a last effort to repel the enemy Felton Meges Hector is here represented as an instrument in the hand of Jupiter to bring about the design the God had long ago projected As his fatal hour now approaches Jove is willing to recompense his early death with this short-lived glory It may be asked what Pallas has to do with the Fates or what power has she over them? Homer speaks thus because Minerva has already resolved to deceive Hector and exalt Achilles Pallas as the wisdom and knowledge of Jove may be considered as drawing all things to the termination decreed by his councils This termination of the period so little consonant to the beginning of it follows the original where it is esteemed by commentators a great beauty Tr Footnotes for Book XVI

xcfx86xcexb5xcfx81xcexbfxcexbcxcexb5xcexbdxcexbfxcexbd _Iliad per Vill_ The friendship of Achilles and Patroclus was celebrated by all antiquity It is said in the life of Alexander the Great that when that prince visited the monuments of the heroes of Troy and placed a crown upon the tomb of Achilles his friend Hephxc3xa6stion placed another on that of Patroclus; an intimation of his being to Alexander what Patroclus was to Achilles It is also said that Alexander remarked Achilles was happy indeed in having had such a friend to love him when living and such a poet to celebrate him when dead xcfx80xcexb5xcfx81xcexb9xcexb1xcexb3xcexbdxcfx85xcfx84xcexb1xcexb9 A word of incomparable force and that defies translation This charge is in keeping with the ambitious character of Achilles He is unwilling that even his dearest friend should have the honor of conquering Hector The picture of the situation of Ajax exhausted by his efforts pressed by the arms of his assailants and the will of Jupiter is drawn with much graphic power Felton Argus-slayer The mythi which we find in the Iliad respecting Mercury represent him as the god who blessed the land with fertility which was his attribute in the original worship He is represented as loving the daughter of Phthiotian Phylas the possessor of many herds and by her had Eudorus (or riches) whom the aged Phylas fostered and brought up in his house quite a significant local mythus which is here related like others in the usual tone of heroic mythology Muller This passage is an exact description and perfect ritual of the

Brother of Antilochus xcexb1xcexbcxcexb1xcexb9xcexbcxcexb1xcexbaxcexb5xcfx84xcexb7xcexbd is a word which I can find nowhere satisfactorily derived Perhaps it is expressive of great length and I am the

piece and put on together To them therefore the cincture or belt of the Greeks was unnecessary Tr According to the history or fable received in Homers time Sarpedon was interred in Lycia This gave the poet the liberty of making him die at Troy provided that after his death he was carried into Lycia to preserve the fable In those times as at this day princes and persons of rank who died abroad were carried to their own country to be laid in the tomb of their fathers Jacob when dying in Egypt desired his children to carry him to the land of Canaan where he wished to be buried Sarpedon certainly was not slain _in the fleet_ neither can the Greek expression xcexbdxcexb5xcfx89xcexbd xcexb5xcexbd xcexb1xcexb3xcfx89xcexbdxcexb9 be with propriety interpreted _in certamine de navibus_ as Clarke and Mme Dacier are inclined to render it _Juvenum in certamine_ seems equally an improbable sense of it Eustathius indeed and Terrasson supposing Sarpedon to assert that he dies in the middle of the fleet (which was false in fact) are kind enough to vindicate Homer by pleading in his favor that Sarpedon being in the article of death was delirious and knew not in reality where he died But Homer however he may have been charged with now and then a nap (a crime of which I am persuaded he is never guilty) certainly does not slumber here nor needs to be so defended xcex91xcexb3xcfx89xcexbd in the 23d Iliad means the _whole extensive area_ in which the games were exhibited and may therefore here without any strain of the expression be understood to signify the _whole range of shore_ on which the ships were stationed In which case Sarpedon represents the matter as it was saying that he dies xcexbdxcexb5xcfx89xcexbd xcexb5xcexbd xcexb1xcexb3xcfx89xcexbdxcexb9 that is in the neighborhood of the ships and in full prospect of them The translator assumes not to himself the honor of this judicious remark It belongs to Mr Fuseli Tr xcexbbxcexb1xcfx83xcexb9xcexbd xcexbaxcexb7xcfx81 The clouds of thick dust that rise from beneath the feet of the combatants which hinder them from knowing one another xcexa5xcfx80xcexb1xcfx83xcfx80xcexb9xcexb4xcexb9xcexb1 xcfx80xcfx81xcexbfxcexb2xcexb9xcexb2xcfx89xcexbdxcfx84xcexbfxcfx82 A similar expression occurs in Book xiii 158 There we read xcfx85xcfx80xcexb1xcfx83xcfx80xcexb9xcexb4xcexb9xcexb1 xcfx80xcfx81xcexbfxcfx80xcexbfxcexb4xcexb9xcexb6xcfx89xcexbd Which is explained by the Scholiast in Villoisson to signify advancing with quick short steps and at the same time covering the feet with a shield A practice which unless they bore the xcexb1xcexbcxcfx86xcexb9xcexb2xcfx81xcexbfxcfx84xcexb7xcexbd xcexb1xcfx83xcfx80xcexb9xcexb4xcexb1 must necessarily leave the upper parts exposed It is not improbable though the translation is not accommodated to that conjecture that xc3x86neas in his following speech to Meriones calls him xcexbfxcfx81xcfx87xcexb7xcfx83xcfx84xcexb7xcexbd with a view to the agility with which he performed this particular step in battle Tr Two lines occurring here in the original which contain only the same matter as the two preceding and which are found neither in the MSS use by Barnes nor in the Harleian the translator has omitted them in his version as interpolated and superfluous Tr xcex99xcfx81xcexb1 xcfx84xcexb1xcexbbxcexb1xcexbdxcfx84xcexb1 _Voluntatem Jovis cui cedendum_ So it is interpreted is the Scholium MSS Lipsiensis Vide Schaufelbergerus Tr It is an opinion of great antiquity that when the soul is on the point of leaving the body its views become stronger and clearer and the mind is endowed with a spirit of true prediction Footnotes for Book XVII In the chase the spoils of the prey the hide and head of the animal belonged to the one who gave the first wound So in war the one who first pierced an enemy slain in battle was entitled to his armor The expediency and utility of prayer Homer misses no opportunity of enforcing Cold and comfortless as the religious creed of the heathens was they were piously attentive to its dictates and to a degree that may serve as a reproof to many professed believers of revelation The allegorical history of prayer given us in the 9th Book of the Iliad from the lips of Phxc5x93nix the speech of Antilochus in the 23d in which he ascribes the ill success of Eumelus in the chariot race to his neglect of prayer and that of Pisistratus in the 3d book of the Odyssey where speaking of the newly-arrived Telemachus he says; For I deem Him wont to pray; since all of every land Need succor from the Gods; are so many proofs of the truth of this remark; to which a curious reader might easily add a multitude Tr There is no word in our language expressive of loud sound at all comparable in effect to the Greek _Bo-o-osin_ I have therefore endeavored by the juxta-position of two words similar in sound to palliate in some degree defect which it was not in my power to cure Tr Or collar-bone The proper meaning of xcexb5xcfx80xcexb9xcexbfxcfx83xcexb1xcexbfxcexbcxcexb5xcexbdxcfx89 is not simply _looking on_ but _providing against_ And thus their ignorance of the death of Patroclus is accounted for They were ordered by Nestor to a post in which they should have little to do themselves except to superintend others and were consequently too remote from Patroclus to see him fall or even to hear that he had fallen See Villoisson Tr This is one of the similes of Homer which illustrates the manners and customs of his age The mode of preparing hides for use is particularly described They were first softened with oil and then were stretched every direction by the hands of men so that the moisture might be removed and the oil might penetrate them Considered in the single point of comparison intended it gives a lively picture of the struggle on all sides to get possession of the body Felton This is the proper imperfect of the verb _chide_ though modern usage has substituted _chid_ a word of mean and awkward sound in the place of it This alludes to the custom of placing columns upon tombs on which were frequently represented chariots with two or four horses The horses standing still to mourn for their master could not be more finely represented than by the dumb sorrow of images standing over a tomb Perhaps the very posture in which these horses are described their heads bowed down and their manes falling in the dust has an allusion to the attitude in which those statues on monuments were usually represented; there are bas-reliefs that favor this conjecture The Latin plural of Ajax is sometimes necessary because the English plural Ajaxes would be insupportable Tr Lexc3xaftus was another chief of the Bxc5x93otians Tr xcex94xcexb9xcfx86xcfx81xcfx89 xcexb5xcfx86xcexb5xcfx83xcfx84xcexb1xcexbfxcfx84xcexbfxcfx82 Yet we learn soon after that he fought on foot But the Scholiast explains the expression thus xcexbdxcexb5xcfx89xcfx83xcfx84xcexb9 xcfx84xcfx89 xcexb4xcexb9xcfx86xcfx89xcfx89 xcexb5xcfx80xcexb9xcexb2xcexb1xcexbdxcfx84xcexbfxcfx82 The fact was that Idomeneus had left the camp on foot and was on foot when Hector prepared to throw at him But Cxc5x93ranus charioteer of Meriones observing his danger drove instantly to his aid Idomeneus had just time to mount and the spear designed for him struck Cxc5x93ranus For a right understanding of this very intricate and difficult passage I am altogether indebted to the Scholiast as quoted by Villoisson Tr The translator here follows the interpretation preferred by the Scholiast The original expression is ambiguous and may signify either that _we shall perish in the fleet ourselves_ or that Hector will soon be in the midst of it Vide Villoisson _in loco_ Tr A noble instance of the heroism of Ajax who asks not deliverance from the Trojans or that he may escape alive but light only without which be could not possibly distinguish himself The tears of such a warrior and shed for such a reason are singularly affecting Tr Footnotes for Book XVIII This speech of Antilochus may serve as a model for its brevity This form of manifesting grief is frequently alluded to in the classical writers and sometimes in the Bible The lamentation of Achilles is in the spirit of the heroic times and the poet describes it with much simplicity The captives join in the lamentation perhaps in the recollection of his gentleness which has before been alluded to Felton Here it is that the drift of the whole poem is fulfilled The evils consequent on the quarrel between him and Agamemnon at last teach Achilles himself this wisdom that wrath and strife are criminal and pernicious; and the confession is extorted from his own lips that the lesson may be the more powerfully inculcated To point the instruction to leaders of armies only is to narrow its operation unnecessarily The moral is of universal application and the poets beneficent intentions are wronged by one so partial Tr The promise of Thetis to present her son with a suit of armor was the most artful method of hindering him from putting immediately in practice his resolution of fighting which with his characteristic violence he would otherwise have done The sun is said to set with reluctance because his setting-time was not yet come Jupiter had promised Hector that he should prevail till the sun should go down and _sacred darkness cover all_ Juno therefore impatient to arrest the victors progress and having no other means of doing it shortens the time allotted him Tr xcexbaxcexb1xcfx84xcexb1xcexb4xcexb7xcexbcxcexbfxcexb2xcexbfxcfx81xcexb7xcfx83xcexb1xcexb9 This custom of washing the dead is continued among the Greeks to this day and is performed by the dearest friend or relative The body is then anointed with a perfume and covered with linen exactly in the manner here related Among the Greeks visitors of rank are still honored in the same manner by being set apart from the rest of the company on a high seat with a footstool xcex91xcexbdxcexb5xcexb4xcfx81xcexb1xcexbcxcexb5 The description of the shield of Achilles is one of the noblest passages in the Iliad It is elaborated to the highest finish of poetry The verse is beautifully harmonious and the language as nicely chosen and as descriptive as can be conceived But a still stronger interest belongs to this episode when considered as an exact representation of life at a very early period of the world as it undoubtedly was designed by the poet It is certainly a most remarkable passage for the amount of information it conveys relative to the state of arts and the general condition of life at that period From many intimations in the ancient authors it may be gathered that shields were often adorned by deities of figures in bas-relief similar to those here described In particular see xc3x86schylus in the Seven against Thebes A close examination of the whole passage will lead to many curious inductions and inferences relative to the ancient world and throw much light upon points which are elsewhere left in great obscurity Felton Murder was not always punished with death or even banishment But on the payment of a fine the criminal was allowed to remain in the city Linus was the most ancient name in poetry the first upon record as inventor of verse and measure among the Grecians There was a solemn custom among the Greeks of bewailing annually their first poet Pausanias informs us that before the yearly sacrifice to the Muses on Mount Helicon the obsequies of Linus were performed who had a statue and altar erected to him in that place In this passage Homer is supposed to allude to that custom See article Theseus Gr and Rom Mythology There were two kinds of dance the Pyrrhic and the common dance; both are here introduced The Pyrrhic or military is performed by Youths wearing swords the other by the virgins crowned with garlands The Grecian dance is still performed in this manner in the oriental nations The youths and maidens dance in a ring beginning slowly; by degrees the music plays in quicker time till at last they dance with the utmost swiftness; and towards the conclusion they sing in a general chorus The point of comparison is this When the potter first tries the wheel to see if it will run he moves it much faster than when at work Thus it illustrates the rapidity of the dance Felton Footnotes for Book XIX Brave men are great weepers was a proverbial saying in Greece Accordingly there are few of Homers heroes who do not weep plenteously on occasion True courage is doubtless compatible with the utmost sensibility See Villoisson Tr The fear with which the divine armor filled the Myrmidons and the exaltation of Achilles the terrible gleam of his eye and his increased desire for revenge are highly poetical Felton The ancients had a great horror of putrefaction previous to interment Achilles in the first book also summons a council himself and not as was customary by a herald It seems a stroke of character and intended by the poet to express the impetuosity of his spirit too ardent for the observance of common forms and that could trust no one for the dispatch he wanted Tr xcex91xcfx83xcfx80xcexb1xcfx83xcexb9xcfx89xcfx82 xcexb3xcexbfxcexbdxcfx85 xcexbaxcexb1xcexbcxcfx88xcexb5xcexb9xcexbd Shall be glad to bend their knee ie to sit and repose themselves Tr xcexa4xcexbfxcfx85xcfx84xcexbfxcexbd xcexbcxcfx85xcexb8xcexbfxcexbd He seems to intend the reproaches sounded in his ear from all quarters and which he had repeatedly heard before Tr By some calld Antibia by others Nicippe Tr It was unlawful to eat the flesh of victims that were sacrificed in confirmation of oaths Such were victims of malediction Nothing can be more natural than the representation of these unhappy young women; who weary of captivity take occasion from every mournful occurrence to weep afresh though in reality little interested in the objects that call forth these expressions of sorrow Dacier Son of Deidameia daughter of Lycomedes in whose house Achilles was concealed at the time when he was led forth to the war We are not warranted in accounting any practice unnatural or absurd merely because it does not obtain among ourselves I know not that any historian has recorded this custom of the Grecians but that it was a custom among them occasionally to harangue their horses we may assure ourselves on the authority of Homer who would not have introduced such speeches if they could have appeared as strange to his countrymen as they do to us Tr Hence it seems that too great an insight into futurity or the revelation of more than was expedient was prevented by the Furies Trollope Footnotes for Book XX This rising ground was five stadia in circumference and was between the river Simois and a village named Ilicon in which Paris is said to have decided between the goddesses It was called Callicolone being the most conspicuous ground in the neighborhood of the city Villoisson Tr Iris is the messenger of the gods on ordinary occasions Mercury on those of importance But Themis is now employed because the affair in question is a council and to assemble and dissolve councils is her peculiar Province The return of Achilles is made as magnificent as possible A council in heaven precedes it and a battle of the gods is the consequence Villoisson Tr The readiness of Neptune to obey the summons is particularly noticed on account of the resentment he so lately expressed when commanded by Jupiter to quit the battle Villoisson Tr The description of the battle of the gods is strikingly grand Jupiter thunders in the heavens Neptune shakes the boundless earth and the high mountain-tops; Ida rocks on its base and the city of the Trojans and the ships of the Greeks tremble; and Pluto leaps from his throne in terror lest his loathsome dominions should be laid open to mortals and immortals Felton The Leleges were a colony of Thessalians and the first inhabitants of the shores of the Hellespont Tr Hector was the son of Priam who descended from Ilus and xc3x86neas the son of Anchises whose descent was from Assaracus the brother of Ilus This dialogue between Achilles and xc3x86neas when on the point of battle as well as several others of a similar description have been censured as improbable and impossible The true explanation is to be found in the peculiar character of war in the heroic age A similar passage has been the subject of remark Felton Some commentators supposing the golden plate the outermost as the most ornamental have perplexed themselves much with this passage for how say they could two folds be pierced and the spear be stopped by the gold if the gold lay on the surface? But to avoid the difficulty we need only suppose that the gold was inserted between the two plates of brass and the two of tin; Vulcan in this particular having attended less to ornament than to security See the Scholiast in Villoisson who argues at large in favor of this opinion Tr Tmolus was a mountain of Lydia and Hyda a city of the same country The Gygxc3xa6an lake was also in Lydia Neptune So called either because he was worshiped on Helicon a mountain of Bxc5x93otia or from Helice an island of Achaia where he had a temple Tr If the bull bellowed as he was led to the altar it was considered a favorable omen Hence the simile Felton It is an amiable trait in the character of Hector that his pity in this instance supercedes his caution and that at the sight of his brother in circumstances so affecting he becomes at once inattentive to himself and the command of Apollo Tr Footnotes for Book XXI The scene is now entirely changed and the battle diversified with a vast variety of imagery and description It is worthy of notice that though the whole war of the Iliad was upon the banks of these rivers yet Homer has reserved the machinery of the river-gods to aggrandize his hero in this battle There is no book in the poem which exhibits greater force of imagination none in which the inexhaustible invention of the poet is more powerfully exerted The swarms of locusts that sometimes invade whole countries in the East have often been described It seems that the ancient mode of exterminating them was to kindle a fire and thus drive them into a lake or river The simile illustrates in the most striking manner the panic caused by Achilles Felton According to the Scholiast Arisba was a city of Thrace and near to the Hellespont; but according to Eustathius a city of Troas inhabited by a colony from Mitylene It was an ancient custom to cast living horses into rivers to honor as it were the rapidity of their streams This gives us an idea of the superior strength of Achilles His spear pierced so deep in the ground that another hero of great strength could not disengage it but immediately after Achilles draws it with the utmost ease xcex91xcexbaxcfx81xcexbfxcexbaxcexb5xcexbbxcexb1xcexb9xcexbdxcexb9xcexbfxcfx89xcexbd The beauty and force of this word are wonderful; I have in vain endeavored to do it justice Tr The reason given in the Scholium is that the surface being hardened by the wind the moisture remains unexhaled from beneath and has time to saturate the roots See Villoisson Tr xcex91xcexbcxcexb2xcexbfxcexbbxcexb1xcexb4xcexb7xcexbd Homer represents Aphrodite as the protector of xc3x86neas and in the battle of the Trojans Ares appears in a disadvantageous light; the weakness of the goddess and the brutal confidence of the god are described with evident irony In like manner Diana and the river-god Scamander sometimes play a very undignified part Apollo alone uniformly maintains his dignity Muller This is a very beautiful soliloquy of Agenor such as would naturally arise in the soul of a brave man going upon a desperate enterprise From the conclusion it is evident that the story of Achilles being invulnerable except in the heel is an invention of a later age Footnotes for Book XXII This simile is very striking It not only describes the appearance of Achilles but is peculiarly appropriate because the star was supposed to be of evil omen and to bring with it disease and destruction So Priam beholds Achilles splendid with the divine armor and the destined slayer of his son Felton The usual cruelties practised in the sacking of towns Isaiah foretells to Babylon that her children shall be dashed in pieces by the Medes David says to the same city Happy shall he be that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones Ps c22vii 9 It was supposed that venomous serpents were accustomed to eat poisonous roots and plants before attacking their victims Felton This speech of Hector shows the fluctuation of his mind with much discernment on the part of the poet He breaks out after having apparently meditated a return to the city But the imagined reproaches of Polydamas and the anticipated scorn of the Trojans forbid it He soliloquizes upon the possibility of coming to terms with Achilles and offering him large concessions; but the character of Achilles precludes all hope of reconciliation It is a fearful crisis with him and his mind wavers as if presentient of his approaching doom Felton The repetition follows the original and the Scholiast is of opinion that Homer uses it here that he may express more emphatically the length to which such conferences are apt to proceed xcex94xcexb9xcexb1 xcfx84xcexb7xcexbd xcfx80xcexbfxcexbbxcfx85xcexbbxcexbfxcexb3xcexb9xcexb1xcexbd xcfx84xcexb7 xcexb1xcexbdxcexb1xcexbbxcexb7xcfx88xcexb5 xcexb5xcfx87xcfx81xcexb7xcfx83xcexb1xcfx84xcexbf Tr It grew near to the tomb of Ilus The Scamander ran down the eastern side of Ida and at the distance of three stadia from Troy making a subterraneous dip it passed under the walls and rose again in the form of the two fountains here described from which fountains these rivulets are said to have proceeded It was the custom of that age to have cisterns by the side of rivers and fountains to which the women including the wives and daughters of kings and princes resorted to wash their garments Sacrifices were offered to the gods upon the hills and mountains or in the language of scripture upon the _high places_ for the people believed that the gods inhabited such eminences The numbers in the original are so constructed as to express the painful struggle that characterizes such a dream Tr xcfx80xcfx81xcexbfxcfx80xcfx81xcexbfxcexbaxcfx85xcexbbxcexb9xcexbdxcexb4xcexbfxcexbcxcexb5xcexbdxcexbfxcfx82 The whole circumference of ancient Troy is said to have measured sixty stadia A stadium measured one hundred and twenty-five paces The knees of the conqueror were a kind of sanctuary to which the vanquished fled for refuge Tr The lines of which these three are a translation are supposed by some to have been designed for the xcex95xcfx80xcexb9xcexbdxcexb9xcexbaxcexb9xcexbfxcexbd or song of victory sung by the whole army Tr It was a custom in Thessaly to drag the slayer around the tomb of the slain; which custom was first begun by Simon whose brother being killed by Eurydamas he thus treated the body of the murderer Achilles therefore being a Thessalian when he thus dishonors Hector does it merely in compliance with the common practice of his country Tr It is an observation of the Scholiast that two more affecting spectacles cannot be imagined than Priam struggling to escape into the field and Andromache to cast herself from the wall; for so he understands xcexb1xcfx84xcfx85xcexb6xcexbfxcexbcxcexb5xcexbdxcexb7xcexbd xcexb1xcfx80xcexbfxcexbbxcexb5xcfx83xcexb8xcexb1xcexb9 Tr A figurative expression In the style of the orientals marrow and fatness are taken for whatever is best most tender and most delicious Homer is in nothing more excellent than in the distinction of characters which he maintains throughout the poem What Andromache here says cannot be said with propriety by any one but Andromache Footnotes for Book XXIII According to the oriental custom David mourns in the same manner refusing to wash or take any repast and lies upon the earth Bacchus having hospitably entertained Vulcan in the island of Naxos one of the Cyclades received from him a cup as a present; but being driven afterward by Lycurgus into the sea and kindly protected by Thetis he presented her with this work of Vulcan which she gave to Achilles for a receptacle of his bones after death Tr The funeral pile was a square of a hundred feet on each side Tr The ceremony of cutting off the hair in honor of the dead was practised not only among the Greeks but among other nations Ezekiel describing a great lamentation says They shall make themselves utterly bald for thee ch xxvii 31 If it was the general custom of any country to wear long hair then the cutting it off was a token of sorrow; but if the custom was to wear it short then letting it grow in neglect was a sign of mourning It was the custom of the ancients not only to offer their own hair to the river-gods of their country but also the hair of their children In Egypt hair was consecrated to the Nile Westering wheel Milton Himself and the Myrmidons That the body might be the more speedily consumed The same end was promoted by the flagons of oil and honey Tr Homer here introduces the gods of the winds in person and as Iris or the rainbow is a sign of winds they are made to come at her bidding Such it appears to have been in the sequel Tr xcexa6xcexb9xcexb1xcexbbxcexb7 a vessel as Athenxc3xa6us describes it made for the purpose of warming water It was formed of brass and expanded somewhat in the shape of a broad leaf Tr The poet omits no opportunity of paying honor to Nestor His age has disabled him from taking an active part in the games yet Antilochus wins not by the speed of his horses but by the wisdom of Nestor This could not happen unless the felly of the wheel were nearly horizontal to the eye of the spectator in which case the chariot must be infallibly overturned There is an obscurity in the passage which none of the commentators explain The Scholiast as quoted by Clarke attempts an explanation but I think not successfully Tr Eumelus Resentful of the attack made on him by Diomede in the fifth Book The twin monster or double man called the Molions They were sons of Actor and Molione and are said to have had two heads with four hands and four feet and being so formed were invincible both in battle and in athletic exercises Even Hercules could only slay them by stratagem which he did when he desolated Elis See Villoisson Tr The repetition follows the original Tr xcfx80xcexb1xcfx81xcexb1xcexbaxcexb1xcexb2xcexb2xcexb1xcexbbxcexb5 With which they bound on the cestus Tr xcfx84xcexb5xcfx84xcfx81xcexb9xcexb3xcexb5xcexb9 It is a circumstance on which the Scholiast observes that it denotes in a wrestler the greatest possible bodily strength and firmness of position See Villoisson Tr I have given what seems to me the most probable interpretation and such a one as to any person who has ever witnessed a wrestling-match will I presume appear intelligible Tr The Sidonians were celebrated not only as the most ingenious artists but as great adepts in science especially in astronomy and arithmetical calculation Tr King of Lemnos That is to say Ulysses; who from the first intending it had run close behind him Tr The prodigious weight and size of the quoit is described with the simplicity of the orientals and in the manner of the heroic ages The poet does not specify the quantity of this enormous piece of iron but the use it will be to the winner We see from hence that the ancients in the prizes they proposed had in view not only the honorable but the useful; a captive for work a bull for tillage a quoit for the provision of iron which in those days was scarce The use of this staff was to separate the cattle It had a string attached to the lower part of it which the herdsman wound about his hand and by the help of it whirled the staff to a prodigious distance Villoisson Tr The transition from narrative to dramatic follows the original Tr Apollo; frequently by Homer called the King without any addition Tr Teucer is eminent for his archery yet he is excelled by Meriones who had not neglected to invoke Apollo the god of archery Footnotes for Book XXIV This is the first allusion in the Iliad to the _Judgment of Paris_ which gave mortal offence to Minerva and Juno On this account it has been supposed by some that these lines are spurious on the ground that Homer could not have known the fable or he would have mentioned it earlier in the poem Felton His blessing if he is properly influenced by it; his curse in its consequences if he is deaf to its dictates Tr This is the sense preferred by the Scholiast for it is not true that Thetis was always present with Achilles as is proved by the passage immediately ensuing Tr The anglers custom was in those days to guard his line above the hook from the fishes bite by passing it through a pipe of horn Tr Jupiter justifies him against Apollos charge affirming him to be free from those mental defects which chiefly betray men into sin folly improvidence and perverseness Tr But at first he did fly It is therefore spoken as the Scholiast observes xcfx86xcexb9xcexbbxcexbfxcfx83xcfx84xcexbfxcfx81xcexb3xcfx89xcfx82 and must be understood as the language of strong maternal affection Tr xcexbaxcexbfxcfx81xcexbfxcexb9xcfx84xcfx85xcfx80xcexb9xcexb7xcfx83xcexb9xcexbd xcexb1xcfx81xcexb9xcfx83xcfx84xcexbfxcexb9 Through which the reins were passed Tr The yoke being flat at the bottom and the pole round there would of course be a small aperture between the band and the pole on both sides through which according to the Scholium in Villoisson they thrust the ends of the tackle lest they should dangle Tr The text here is extremely intricate; as it stands now the sons are first said to yoke the horses then Priam and Idxc3xa6us are said to do it and in the palace too I have therefore adopted an alteration suggested by Clarke who with very little violence to the copy proposes instead of xcexb6xcexb5xcfx85xcexb3xcexbdxcfx85xcfx83xcexb8xcexb7xcexbd to read xcexb6xcfx89xcexbdxcexbdxcfx85xcfx83xcexb8xcexb7xcexbd Tr The words both signify sable Tr Priam begins not with a display of the treasures he has brought for the redemption of Hectors body but with a pathetic address to the feelings of Achilles Homer well knew that neither gold nor silver would influence the heart of a young and generous warrior but that persuasion would The old king therefore with a judicious abruptness avails himself of his most powerful plea at once and seizes the sympathy of the hero before he has time to recollect who it is that addresses him Mortified to see his generosity after so much kindness shown to Priam still distrusted and that the impatience of the old king threatened to deprive him of all opportunity to do gracefully what he could not be expected to do willingly Tr To control anger argues a great mind and to avoid occasions that may betray one into it argues a still greater An observation that should suggest itself to us with no little force when Achilles not remarkable either for patience or meekness exhorts Priam to beware of provoking him; and when having cleansed the body of Hector and covered it he places it himself in the litter lest his father seeing how indecently he had treated it should be exasperated at the sight and by some passionate reproach exasperate himself also For that a person so singularly irascible and of a temper harsh as his should not only be aware of his infirmity but even guard against it with so much precaution evidences a prudence truly wonderful Plutarch Tr xcex95xcfx80xcexb9xcexbaxcexb5xcfx81xcfx84xcexbfxcexbcxcexb5xcfx89xcexbd Clarke renders the word in this place _falso metxc3xbb ludens_ and Eustathius says that Achilles suggested such cause of fear to Priam to excuse his lodging him in an exterior part of the tent The general import of the Greek word is sarcastic but here it signifies rather to intimidate See also Dacier Tr The poet here shows the importance of Achilles in the army Agamemnon is the general yet all the chief commanders appeal to him for advice and on his own authority he promises Priam a cessation of arms Giving his hand to confirm the promise agrees with the custom of the present day This lament of Andromache may be compared to her pathetic address to Hector in the scene at the Scxc3xa6an gate It forms indeed a most beautiful and eloquent pendant to that Felton This according to the Scholiast is a probable sense of xcfx80xcfx81xcexbfxcfx83xcfx86xcexb1xcfx84xcexbfxcfx82 He derives it xcexb1xcfx80xcexbf xcfx84xcfx89xcexbd xcexbdxcexb5xcfx89xcfx83xcfx84xcexb9 xcfx80xcexb5xcfx86xcexb1xcfx83xcexbcxcexb5xcexbdxcfx89xcexbd xcexb5xcexba xcexb3xcexb7xcfx82 xcfx86xcfx85xcfx84xcfx89xcexbd See Villoisson Tr Helen is throughout the Iliad a genuine lady graceful in motion and speech noble in her associations full of remorse for a fault for which higher powers seem responsible yet grateful and affectionate towards those with whom that fault had connected her I have always thought the following speech in which Helen laments Hector and hints at her own invidious and unprotected situation in Troy as almost

electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone For forty years he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support Project Gutenberg-tm

in compliance with any particular paper edition Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility wwwgutenbergorg This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks
